00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
You are all doing a great job.
Ryota, did your teacher give you any explanation
about the materials?

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes, I have a lot of photos, illustrations,
newspaper articles, etc., as reference materials. 

00:20.000 --> 00:24.500
We were given a list categorized as to
whether they were the teacher’s originals or those of others.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.000
She told me to be careful with other people’s copyrighted materials.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
In principle, when using the copyrighted works of others,
it is necessary to obtain permission from the copyright owner.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
However, under certain conditions, it may be used without a license.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
In this case, what other types of works
besides the teacher's works are involved?
Let's look at some specifics.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
We who help them have to understand it too!

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Actually, I don’t really understand copyright,
so thanks for the help!

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
Let’s start with the public domain.
Ryota, do you know what the public domain is?

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes. It is a copyrighted work that anyone is free to use.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Yes, that’s right.
To be precise, it includes not only copyrighted works
but also patents and other intellectual property rights.

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
In any case, if no rights have been created or
the rights have expired, the work can be used freely.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Eh. No rights created? Expired? What does that mean?

01:33.000 --> 01:45.000
It can get complicated, so let’s just focus on copyright here!
A copyright is automatically created when the author creates the work.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
And when the protection term ends,
it becomes a copyrighted work that anyone can use.

01:52.000 --> 02:04.000
This is because the Copyright Law is designed to protect the rights
of authors and to ensure fair exploitationof copyrighted works
and to balance the two and contribute to the development of culture.

02:04.000 --> 02:13.000
The protection term depends on the type of work but currently,
it is generally 70 years after the author's death.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
70 years! That's a long time!

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
Sure, it's a long time. But when that protection term ends, the rights expire.
You mean they become freely available?

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
Yes. However, even after the author’s death,
if works may be offered or presented to the public,

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
you are not allowed to use them in a way that infringes
on the moral rights of the author.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Please keep that in mind. 
Now, in the materials, you can use the works

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
that the protection term has expired
at the open campus without any problems!

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Yes...so the materials like this are fine.

02:54.000 --> 03:07.000
Um, excuse me. I understand that rights expire.
But what kind of works don’t have rights?

03:07.000 --> 03:16.000
For example, the Constitution, statutes, court decisions, etc.,
are not subject to copyright and moral rights.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
This is because the government and others aim
to make its contents widely known.

03:22.000 --> 03:33.000
Another example of rights expiring even within the protection term is
when copyright owners may have relinquished their rights
and declared them in the public domain.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
So that’s how it is! So, even within the protection term,
it is okay if the copyright owner declares it.

03:40.000 --> 03:50.000
Yes. However, simply saying that you are free
to use copyrighted material is not enough.
Please note that this does not constitute a waiver of copyright.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
The same applies to free materials. Please check the scope of use approved
by the copyright owner. We need to comply with it.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
“You can use it," is certainly a license to use, isn’t it?
I would not mistake it for a waiver of rights.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
Also...the teacher's list contained some works
that used a Creative Commons license.

04:15.000 --> 04:25.000
A Creative Commons license is a license in which the copyright owner
specifies the scope of use of the copyrighted material in advance
by attaching a designated mark to express intent.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.500
It's one of the forms of licensing, and it's becoming quite common these days.

04:31.500 --> 04:40.000
The advantage is that the copyright owner presents this information
along with the content, allowing users to use it within the permitted scope of use. 

04:40.000 --> 04:51.000
Creative Commons licenses include, Attribution, NonCommercial, NoDerivatives,
ShareAlike, and you can express your intention by combining these marks.

04:52.000 --> 05:00.000
It would be easier to use copyrighted material
if all content was marked with this kind of symbol.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
That would be a big help.
Yes, we are still in the early stages.

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
In the future, as with the Creative Commons license it would be desirable
for copyright owners to express some intention to promote
the use of their copyrighted work.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
Well, Ryota, I think you still have some things left
on your teacher's list, how do you plan to handle those?

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
Let's see, we are almost there.
 I think it’s okay to cite some of the newspaper articles.

05:29.000 --> 05:42.000
Yes, that is correct. I’ll elaborate on that another time,
but if the requirements for citation are met,
they can be used under the limitation of copyright.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
The rest of the materials were ones that the teachers had
individually obtained permission to use for their classes only,

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
so we gave up on using them as they were for the open campus.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
Instead, I am thinking of taking my own photos and drawing illustrations.

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
Ah, so that’s where I come in!
Then I’ll put it in the public domain as a special favor!

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
Senior I’d like some delicious sweets. I’ll get a reward right?

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
You remembered that. You’re so smart!
