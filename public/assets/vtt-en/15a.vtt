I have many illustrations,
so I thought I’d release them to the public.

00:22.500 --> 00:27.500
Aoi’s illustrations look good and will be popular.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
By the way, what kind of release are you thinking of?
Something like “Sashieyasan”?

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Yeah. But I can’t make terms of use like Sashieyasan,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
so I’m wondering what I should do.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
That’s true.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
When we were doing the poster for the band club, you said that
we should read the “User Guide” of Sashieyasan together.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.500
Kasumi... this is no laughing matter, it’s true.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.500
Do you think someone like that can make terms of use?

00:56.500 --> 00:59.500
Now, now, there’s no need to be like that.

00:59.500 --> 01:03.500
I think you can do it if you try. Take a look at Sashieyasan
for your reference.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.000
Hmm, I guess so.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.500
I’m thinking of just using credit from the Creative Commons
license, which I learned about before,

01:11.500 --> 01:16.000
and then making it available for use freely.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.500
If you add a well-known license, that you see all the time,
that’s all you need to do, right? I think I can do it too.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.500
It’s called CC-BY.

01:25.500 --> 01:31.500
Still, I think it will make it possible for others to sell the
illustrations that you provided for free.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.000
Are you okay with that, Aoi? Are you sure it’s alright?

01:35.500 --> 01:41.000
Is that going to happen? I don’t like that!
