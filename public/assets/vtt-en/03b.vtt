00:07.500 --> 00:14.500
Aoi, it must be frustrating when a message is read but ignored.
Do you have any idea why you have not received a reply?

00:14.500 --> 00:24.000
Kasumi always replies, so I was wondering why.
I’m sure it’s because of the video I sent Kasumi, but...

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Kasumi, what did you think
when you saw your video that was revised by Aoi?

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
I thought that was not my intention.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
I know Aoi did it to make it more interesting...
But that’s why I’m feeling a bit uneasy.

00:41.500 --> 00:50.500
You both have your own intentions, but they were misaligned.
Now let me explain what the problem is.

00:50.500 --> 00:55.000
Do you know what moral rights are?

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Moral rights? No. I am not sure.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
As I recall, it’s about copyright.

01:05.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes. Copyrights are broadly classified
into moral rights and economic rights.

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
Copyrights include, for example, the reproduction right,
a well-known right not to be copied without permission.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
Apart from economic rights,
copyright includes personal rights that protect the author.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
These are called moral rights.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
Protecting the personal aspect? That sounds a little abstract.

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
This time, Aoi modified the video made by Kasumi.
Aoi revised it with good intentions.

01:50.000 --> 01:59.000
Yes. I thought it would be more popular.
But...I don’t know if I went too far.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
That was not good.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
A video contains the thoughts and feelings of the person
who created it.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
Moral rights protect such aspects of the author’s personality.

02:12.000 --> 02:23.000
This time, Aoi took the liberty of modifying Kasumi’s video!
But it is an act that violates the integrity right.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
The integrity right is the right not to have work altered
without permission.

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
Indeed. I think the reason I felt uneasy was
because I saw the video had been edited

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
without my permission and I felt like my feelings
about the video were being denied.

02:37.000 --> 02:46.000
In this case, the communication is only between individuals.
Still, it does not change that you have infringed the integrity right.


02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Please be careful not to do such things in the future!

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes, I understand. I’m sorry, Kasumi.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, I’m also sorry I didn’t reply to your message.

03:00.000 --> 03:14.000
Copyrights are assignable, but moral rights are not.
Moral rights are rights granted only to authors.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Do not engage in acts that infringe on the author’s
moral rights when using copyrighted works.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
We need to be very careful.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
What other rights do moral rights include?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
There are publication and attribution rights.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
A publication right is the right not to have a copyrighted work
published without permission.

03:35.000 --> 03:46.000
An attribution right is the right to decide whether or not
the copyrighted work is attributed to the author.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
I see. Only the author has the right to decide when and how to publish.
It’s a personal right.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Yes. Kasumi has not yet published this work,

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
so if Aoi had published it anywhere without permission,
it would also have violated the publication right.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh no.
I don’t think I’d publish it without permission from Kasumi!

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
But nowadays, it can be uploaded immediately
on social media so I should be careful.

04:16.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes, I agree. Because social media is so easy to use,
people tend to be less aware of the importance. Please be careful.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Now, next is the attribution right.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
For example, when you publish your work, you might want to use
your real name as the author, or to use a pen name,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
and there are those who do not want their names to be mentioned.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
What name did you want to use to publish this video, Kasumi?

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
I am going to use “Kasumin” in Katakana just like before.

04:50.000 --> 05:01.000
Yes. The attribution right is the right that allows you
to display the author’s name as you like.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I see.

05:04.000 --> 05:13.000
And one last point. The Copyright Law also provides
provisions regarding infringement and says:

05:13.000 --> 05:24.000
“The exploitation of a work in a way that is prejudicial to the honor
or reputation of the author is deemed to constitute an infringement
of the author’s moral rights.”

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
This violates the “right to preserve author’s honor and reputation.”

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
What are some examples of acts that violate your honor?

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Yes. There is an example of a portrait drawn by a manga artist
at a client’s request being used in a way that the artist did not intend,

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
as a person who agrees with the client’s political or ideological beliefs.

05:46.000 --> 05:57.000
The court found this as an infringement of the right to maintain
the author’s honor or reputation,
as something that harms the honor or reputation of the author.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
As such, you must not use the work in a way that goes against
the author’s intentions.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
This moral right aims to protect the author’s personality
or spiritual aspect.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
This time, I was wrong because I altered the work
without Kasumi’s - the author’s permission.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
That’s the thing, though, when I think about it calmly,
it’s not what I intended.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
The video that Aoi corrected was interesting, too.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Shall I upload both and see how my followers react?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Really? Are you sure?

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
If I, the author, am okay with it, then there is no problem, right?

06:36.000 --> 06:44.000
Yes, you may modify or alter the contents of the video
with the author’s permission.

06:44.000 --> 06:53.000
I won’t go into detail here, but if you are concerned about rights,
consider the right to create derivative works of copyrighted works.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes, I understand!
