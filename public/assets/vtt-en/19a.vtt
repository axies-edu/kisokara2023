Huh? Aoi, you look lost in thought. What happened?

00:33.000 --> 00:37.500
Seriously. That’s not like Aoi at all. If you have any problems,
we’re always here to help!

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I’m in a bit of trouble. Can I talk about it?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.500
Of course, What happened to you?

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
I showed Kasumi my manga before.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.000
Aoi, you draw manga. Let me read it!

00:52.000 --> 00:54.500
Naoya, be quiet for a second.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.500
Of course, I remember it well. You’re not only good at
illustrations, but you are also good at creating stories.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
So, what’s up with that manga?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
My friend told me she wanted to turn the manga
into a novel and upload it to a novel posting site.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.500
She asked for my permission, but I wasn’t sure what to do.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
If she wants to make a novel using your manga,
having your permission would undoubtedly be better.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.000
So, what do you want to do?

01:23.500 --> 01:33.000
Well, it means that my manga has been recognized,
so I’d like to grant permission if possible.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.500
But I don’t really understand what novel posting sites are,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.500
and she wants to change the ending or shorten the story a little.

01:43.500 --> 01:48.000
I don’t know how it will change, and I’m worried.

01:48.500 --> 01:53.000
For now, let’s take a closer look at that site together.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.500
Is it okay if I take a look at it with you too?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.500
Of course!

01:59.500 --> 02:05.000
Naoya please give me some advice too.
It’s a website called “Let’s Write a Novel.”
