00:09.000 --> 00:14.500
It isn’t easy to define the scope of intellectual property rights.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
This time, we’re talking about car designs.
It’s a pretty good topic.

00:21.500 --> 00:26.000
Yes. As I studied, I noticed more and more things.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.500
It means I’m learning a little more, right?

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
That’s right. Now, let me explain.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Intellectual property rights allow people

00:40.000 --> 00:46.500
to protect the property information
created by creative activities from unfair imitation.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
For creations, the interests of the creators are protected.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
However, I have heard similar explanations about copyright.

00:58.500 --> 01:02.000
Is this different from copyright?

01:02.500 --> 01:10.000
Copyright is one of the intellectual property rights
under such an idea.

01:10.500 --> 01:16.000
In addition to copyright, there are many other types
of intellectual property rights.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.500
There are so many! I wonder if I can remember them all.

01:20.500 --> 01:26.000
But there are some words I’ve heard before,
like patent and trademark.

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
That’s right. Intellectual property rights are rights related to
information from human intellectual activities, etc.,

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
related to various parts of society.
I’m sure you’ve heard of many of them before

01:41.500 --> 01:46.000
Patents, for example, relate to inventions.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
Anyone with a technical idea to make something is called
an inventor, right?

01:52.500 --> 01:56.000
By applying the concept that a person thought of,

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
the person can obtain exclusive patents and profit
from the invention.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.500
Copyright is similar,
but the subject matter and procedures are different.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Copyright applies to things that are expressed, right?

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
Copyright does not protect ideas, nor is there a need for
application procedures. I see, it’s different.

02:21.500 --> 02:30.000
That’s right. Copyright occurs at the moment copyrighted work
is created without any procedures.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.500
This is called an automatic protection system.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
Since there is no registration or examination,
people coincidently can create works similar
to other people’s work.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.500
In such a case, it does not constitute a copyright infringement,
and both parties will have copyright.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.500
On the other hand, industrial property rights, such as patent,
design, and trademark rights,

02:56.500 --> 03:03.000
unlike copyright, arise when registered with the Patent Office.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.500
Trademark rights cover names, figures, symbols, etc.,

03:09.500 --> 03:17.000
used by companies and other businesses to distinguish their
products and services from those offered by different firms.

03:17.500 --> 03:21.000
This includes company names, product names, logos, etc.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
I see. Indeed, we don’t want people to copy our corporate logos.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.500
What happens to car designs?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.500
Car designs are covered by design rights.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
A design right is the right to use a new design exclusively

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
by registering for mass-produced goods.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.500
This protects the advantages of superior design products

03:52.000 --> 03:57.500
and prevents losing profits to other companies creating products
that imitate their designs.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
The design of a car is essential to its appeal.

04:04.500 --> 04:08.500
I know exactly what you mean
because I liked the design and wanted it, too.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
That’s right. Besides cars, fashion designs are also subject to
such design rights.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Fashion is all about design! It’s fun to choose♪

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
In a somewhat different way, agriculture also has intellectual
property rights.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.500
Agriculture? You mean agricultural products,
such as vegetables and fruits, right?

04:34.000 --> 04:39.500
I thought such things were created naturally and had nothing
to do with intellectual property rights.

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
Surprising right? But there are many different kinds and
varieties of agricultural products.

04:48.500 --> 04:54.000
New varieties are created by combining characteristics
that are useful to people,

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
such as taste, large harvests, and beautiful flowers.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Ah, you mean breeding.

05:04.500 --> 05:12.500
That’s right. The right of breeders is the intellectual property
of a person

05:12.500 --> 05:17.500
who has created a new variety of plants in this way.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.500
New flowers and fruits are treated as the intellectual property
of those who create and register them.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Speaking of which, we have heard in the news

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
that the legislation helps protect brands because popular high-quality grapes and cherries are being grown overseas without permission,

05:36.000 --> 05:40.500
and are being imported.

05:42.500 --> 05:48.000
When I think about it, I feel that new varieties of vegetables
and fruits are an asset

05:48.000 --> 05:54.500
not only to the people who grow the crops but also to the
agriculture industry and society as a whole. 

05:54.500 --> 05:58.500
The Law needs to protect them with legislation.

06:00.500 --> 06:09.500
In addition, the Unfair Competition Prevention Act, which aims to
ensure fair competition among companies and other businesses,

06:09.500 --> 06:15.000
protects trade secrets, such as business know-how and customer
lists,

06:15.000 --> 06:19.500
and regulates the use of names and designs similar to those of
different companies.

06:21.500 --> 06:27.500
I see. The idea of protecting information, such as things made by
someone or labels used in business activities as property,

06:27.500 --> 06:36.000
is a common concept not only for copyright but also for other
intellectual property rights.

06:36.500 --> 06:43.000
By the way Naoya, I heard you’re working hard to buy a car,
but do you think you’ll be able to buy it?

06:43.500 --> 06:51.000
Ah, well, it’s an expensive car, so I don’t know when I can...
I have to earn some money.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.500
How do you make money? By patenting an invention?

06:54.500 --> 06:58.000
By writing a best-selling book?

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
Hmm...maybe I’ll buy a lottery ticket...
