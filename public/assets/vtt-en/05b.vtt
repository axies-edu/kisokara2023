00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
I was so surprised when you suddenly spoke to me.
Well, so what happened?

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Teachers are using works made by other people in their classes.

00:17.000 --> 00:28.000
Yes. Indeed, some of the materials and images used
in school classes include works made by people other than teachers.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Are you sure about the permissions?

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
As we all know, the Copyright Law is the basic rule
in dealing with works created by others.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Usually, permission from the copyright owner is required.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
In addition, there are special rules
that allow using copyrighted material

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
without the copyright owner’s permission
if specific requirements are met.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
This is called the limitation of rights provision.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
When dealing with the copyrighted works of others,
such as materials required for a class, etc.,

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
we no longer need permission
under this right limitation provision.


01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
A provision for limitation of rights?

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes, because this idea of limitation of rights is essential,
you need to understand it as a rule.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Yes, you all noticed an excellent point.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
The purpose of the concept of copyright is
to contribute to the development of culture

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
by encouraging the fair exploitation of copyrighted works
and by protecting the rights of the authors of the copyrighted work.

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
However, cultural development can be done
by using past works and can be helped by learning from them.

01:49.000 --> 02:00.000
For this reason, 
for the benefit of society as a whole and the development of culture,
some limitations may be placed on the rights of the copyright owner.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
This is the concept of copyright limitation, also known as limitation of rights.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
By this limitation of rights,
you may be free to use the copyrighted works of others.

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
This limitation of rights, in limited cases, allows you to use
someone else’s work without the copyright owner’s consent.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Please understand that this is only an exception.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
I see. So, it’s just an exception.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
What other cases are there?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Limitations on copyright include these.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
Typical examples are reproductions for private use,
reproductions in libraries etc.,

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
citations, non-commercial performances, etc.,
and use for education and testing.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
This one, mainly, is a limitation of rights closely related to schools
and educational institutions.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
In addition to the ones just mentioned,

03:05.000 --> 03:15.000
the use of copyrighted works in the broadcast of school educational programs,
the creation of enlarged books for children with disabilities, etc. are also allowed.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
I know it’s an exception, but there are quite a few.

03:20.000 --> 03:31.000
Yes, I know. There are a lot of provisions, but here, in particular,
we explain Article 35,
Reproduction and Public Transmission Rights in Educational Institutions.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
For example, reproducing and distributing a limited number of copies
of a necessary part of another person’s work

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
for teachers, students,and pupils
to use in the classroom falls under the limitation of rights.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
I know you have received photocopied materials in class.

03:50.000 --> 04:00.000
You may not be aware of these, but this is permitted
by the copyright limitations under the Copyright Law.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
I see. Somehow, I usually give and receive copies.
I was unaware of it because I was just doing it.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah. I didn’t know that was allowed by the rules.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Sure, school classes should be for the
“benefit of society as a whole and the development of culture.”

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes. However, it is not simply a matter of being allowed
to use it; several requirements must be met.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
There are quite a lot of requirements.
I wonder if I can remember them.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes, it can be hard to remember them all!

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
However, a person in a position to make or distribute
reproductions should check if necessary. 

04:43.000 -->  04:48.000
Professor, is that right?
Yes.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
What does that mean,
‘not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner’?

04:56.000 --> 05:05.000
I’m not sure what you mean by unjustly harming them,
though the rule of limitation of rights allows it.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
For example, suppose that you may be exposed to the contents
of a specific book in a class or seminar.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
In that case, you can make only the necessary copies
of the parts required.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
If they are to be distributed, they would fall
within the scope of this limitation on rights.

05:26.000 --> 05:35.000
Then, go on with your classes and seminars, what do you think
a reasonable amount of that book should be subject to?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
I would photocopy all the books and distribute them!

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
No, you can’t! Then that book won’t sell,
and the authors or publishers lose their profits.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Do you mean that it unfairly harms the interests of the copyright owner?

05:50.000 --> 05:58.000
That’s right. In the case of classes where a certain percentage 
or more of the content of a book is covered,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I ask the students to buy the book.

06:03.000 --> 06:12.000
Also, the Law was recently amended regarding public transmission
 for classes due to the need for online courses.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
By paying compensation, educational institutions can transmit
other people’s copyrighted works

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
to students through the university system,
as long as the transmission is limited to those taking the course.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
This can be said to be a special form of limitation of rights.

06:29.000 --> 06:37.000
Thanks to this system, our university can now use
other people’s copyrighted works in online classes

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
like face-to-face courses and provide students
with class materials via the university system.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
Until now, we have needed permission from the copyright owner,
which has been quite a difficult hurdle to overcome.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
That must have been hard before.

06:53.000 --> 07:02.000
In addition, limitations of rights also include the right
to reproduce works that have been published for the benefit

07:02.000 --> 07:10.000
of the blind in Braille and the right for those engaged
in certain welfare-related activities to reproduce works

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
in a format that is necessary for deaf people,
such as transcribing the audio of a work into text. 

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
These limitations of rights can also be said to be useful
for the benefit of society as a whole and for the development of culture.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
As you can see, there are many limitations of rights
provisions related to education.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
However, as we have said before,
it is essential to remember that these are exceptions

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
that are limited to cases where the requirements
for the rights of the copyright owner are met.


07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
In other words, just because it is
a class does not mean that everything is free,

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
and it is important to think carefully about whether
the requirements for limitations of rights are met in each situation.
Yes. I understand.
