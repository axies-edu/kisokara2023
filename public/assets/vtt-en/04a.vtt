There are so many. Really...what should I do?
What should I do?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Hi, Ryota. What are you doing?

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
A teacher asked me to make a video
introducing the department for the open campus.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Hello.
Yes, come in.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
You wanted to see me, professor?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Tamura-san. Sorry to bother you. Sit down.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
It was straightforward to understand,
and people gave me positive feedback

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
about the video Tamura-san made in the last class.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Thank you.

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
Actually, at the upcoming open campus,
I was asked to make a video introducing the department
for high school students.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Could you please make that video, Tamura-san? 

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
It would be better for you to make the video from the student’s perspective,
which would interest high school students. What do you think?

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
I’ll pay you for it so please do this favor for me.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.500
Yes. If I can be of any help.

01:26.500 --> 01:33.000
Thanks! This is the material.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Something like that.

01:37.000 --> 01:47.000
An open campus. I was here when I was in high school.
I think it was helpful for me to decide my career path.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Of course, there are content instructions.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
However, most of the contents are excerpts from class materials.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I heard that some of the content is not allowed to be shown
as is due to copyright issues.

01:57.000 --> 02:07.000
I see. Copyrights! I heard that using copyrighted materials
 in classes is becoming more straightforward.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I think it’s the limitation of rights.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
It’s not used in a class for high school students,
so it will change how we use it.

02:12.000 --> 02:22.000
That’s right. It’s more complicated than I thought it would be...
but it’ll be helpful for a student’s career path. I have to do it, right?

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
The professor asked me to do this as a casual request,
but it’s quite complicated.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Come to think of it, Aoi you’re good at drawing illustrations, right?
Can you help me out a little?

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Sure! What should I draw and how?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I can help you if you want.

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
Thank you both. You’re a big help!
I want to explain now. Do you have time?
