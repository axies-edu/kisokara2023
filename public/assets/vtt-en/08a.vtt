I guess it’s something like this. How far along are you two?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Hmm, I guess it’s okay.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
I’m making pretty good progress.
I just found the right article!

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
What are you doing? A report?

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes, I am writing a report on basic data science!

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Did you take this class? The teacher said this class was
recently introduced.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Data Science. I think a course was introduced in my year.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.800
It was rather tricky because of the group work,
but I got the credit. What kind of assignment do you have?

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
It’s an assignment like analyzing a case study of the use of data
and AI and discussing the social changes it brings about.

00:52.000 --> 01:01.000
It isn’t easy to analyze. Do you think it’s okay like this?

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Let me see. 

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
This is...

01:09.000 --> 01:19.000
Senior. I’m very confident about mine, so please take a look.
I found a topic about using data analysis in soccer
to strengthen teams.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Hmmm...

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
What do you think of mine?

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
I see. It sounds pretty well written, but...

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Is there something you are concerned about?

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
I’m a bit concerned about the “citations” from all three of you.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
What’s wrong with my report?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I’m trying to tweak parts of the citations now.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
I was aware of the citations I wrote...am I wrong?

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
All of you seem to have your own problems.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Why?
