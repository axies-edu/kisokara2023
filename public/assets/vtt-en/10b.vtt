00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
That’s it for today’s class. Thank you for your hard work.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.700
Professor! May I have a moment to ask you something?

00:25.700 --> 00:27.000
Okay!

00:28.500 --> 00:31.000
What is it you want to ask me?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
I want to ask about copyright. 

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
I saw an ad in a movie theater warning people not to engage
in voyeurism and illegal downloading.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
What can copyright owners do when there is an infringement?

00:48.000 --> 00:55.500
What caught my attention was an article about a court judgment
in which a person who edited and posted shortened versions of
movies on a video posting site

00:55.500 --> 01:00.000
was sued and awarded hundreds of millions of yen in damages.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.000
After hearing Kasumi’s story, 

01:03.000 --> 01:08.500
I wondered if I edited the video to a shorter length, the story’s
original intent would be lost.

01:09.500 --> 01:17.500
I learned about moral rights before. Can the author of the movie
exercise moral rights?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.500
It’s important for the three of you to have questions.

01:23.000 --> 01:33.000
First, you all know that the Copyright Law aims to protect the
exploitation of copyrighted works and the rights of copyright
owners.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.500
However, in reality, there are illegal activities,
such as copyright infringements.

01:39.500 --> 01:44.500
There are two main actions a copyright owner can take when
there is such an infringement. 

01:45.000 --> 01:52.500
We could say a criminal trial and a civil trial,
but do you understand the difference?

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
No, I don’t know exactly... I’ve heard the names before...

01:59.500 --> 02:02.500
I will explain in detail!

02:03.500 --> 02:05.000
Please.

02:06.000 --> 02:16.500
The difference between a criminal trial and a civil trial is that a
prosecutor prosecutes a criminal trial. If convicted, the defendant
will be given a criminal record.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.000
Scary!

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
Civil trials, on the other hand, are used to settle disputes
between individuals or organizations.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
What Aoi mentioned earlier is a criminal trial.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.500
The Copyright Law provides penalties, such as fines,
imprisonment, or both, to be imposed on copyright infringers.

02:39.500 --> 02:45.000
In Japan, this is the “offence subject to complaint.”

02:45.000 --> 02:52.500
The public prosecutor cannot petition the court for a trial without
a complaint from the person whose rights have been infringed. 

02:53.500 --> 02:59.500
However, selling pirated copies or uploading them to the Internet
is an offense not subject to complaint, 

02:59.500 --> 03:04.500
which means that prosecution is possible
even without a complaint.

03:04.500 --> 03:08.000
Yes.
We have learned about the offence subject to complaint before.

03:09.000 --> 03:19.000
However, while such measures penalize the infringer,
they do not address the infringed party, right?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.500
So, one more thing. As the article Kasumi saw,

03:22.500 --> 03:31.000
the Copyright Law has provisions regarding the claims a
copyright owner can make against an infringer
when infringement occurs.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
This is treated as a civil trial.

03:36.500 --> 03:45.500
Specifically, the copyright owner can demand an injunction
against the infringement and compensation
for damages caused by the infringement.

03:45.500 --> 03:50.500
In addition, regarding the moral rights that
Naoya was concerned about,

03:50.500 --> 03:56.000
the author can also demand measures necessary to restore reputation.

03:58.000 --> 04:09.000
Wasn’t copyright infringement a fine of up to 10 million yen?
What is the amount of damages claimed?

04:09.000 --> 04:14.500
I heard that the article Kasumi saw was for several hundred
million yen after the court judgment.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.000
Let me explain about that. 

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
10 million yen is the maximum fine under the Copyright Law
for criminal cases.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
For a civil case, the Copyright Law provides the following method
for calculating the amount of damages.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.500
In the example that Kasumi mentioned, the amount equivalent to
the royalty fee,

04:39.500 --> 04:46.000
not the profit gained by the infringer, was found as the amount
of damages. It is a considerable amount.

04:47.500 --> 04:55.000
Sure. It’s a claim for damages. You calculate the amount of
damages and file a claim.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Hundreds of millions? Still, that’s a lot of damages.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
That’s why there are so many warnings at movie theaters about
preventing voyeurism and banning illegal downloading.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
Professor, we are not talking about movies, but I want to ask you
about paid software.

05:12.000 --> 05:23.500
For example, if a student uses an illegal copy of the software,
will the software company file a claim for damages?

05:23.500 --> 05:31.000
Kasumi, yes, this has happened in the past at several universities.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.500
Of course,
it has to be proven that the software was illegally copied.

05:36.500 --> 05:43.000
Still, since it can be reported from people in a user company,
recently, the licenses can be verified through the network,

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
and the software company can ascertain this fact.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
After confirming this, there have been cases where they have
claimed damages from universities.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I knew it...

05:57.500 --> 06:05.000
However, in many cases, the parties discuss with each other
and settle the case without actually going to court.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
However, there are some cases where universities pay substantial
amounts of compensation.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
To prevent this,

06:13.000 --> 06:21.500
universities ensure that users use software with proper licenses
and manage them well.

06:21.500 --> 06:28.500
In addition, software used by faculty, staff, and students is now
subject to a contract for a university as a whole

06:28.500 --> 06:36.000
rather than having them purchase individual licenses,
making it more difficult for unauthorized use.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
However, not all software is supported in such a way.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.500
Sometimes things you do without thinking can lead to
severe problems,

06:48.500 --> 06:54.500
so everyone should pay attention to the license
and never use it illegally.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.000
Yes, I understand.
