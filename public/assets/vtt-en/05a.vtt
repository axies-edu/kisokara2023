Naoya, what are you doing? Class?

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
I just wanted to see what you’ve been up to this week.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
That’s Professor Uchida’s class, right?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
She’ll have a lot of material for you,
so you’ll understand precisely what you’re getting.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.500
Yes.

00:26.500 --> 00:35.000
Many videos are used in this class, and the materials are always
available, so it is convenient because you can review them later.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
If you can study while looking at different materials,
you can understand them faster.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
It must be challenging because the professor also prepared
many photos and videos for the class. It must be difficult.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah, if she is doing it alone.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
But when I look at the class materials, I see URLs or the titles of papers.
So, maybe the professor doesn’t make them all.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I think the professor is letting people use what others have made.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
I see. As expected, she can’t do it alone.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
Speaking of using materials made by others,
this reminds me of a video I made the other day.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
People who tried to upload my videos to social media or change them.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
Yes, I’m sorry about that. I should have gotten permission
 from Kasumi, the copyright owner, before doing it.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
Professors are using what others have created in their classes, right?

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
This video is one example as are the paper materials
that are handed out during face-to-face classes...

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
That’s what I’ve heard.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
When professors also use materials made by others as class materials,
I am still wondering if they are contacting that person and getting permission.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
We copied newspaper articles and distributed them for group work in class.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
We didn’t contact the newspaper or anything.
Is that okay?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Professor, what’s going on?
