00:08.500 --> 00:11.500
Everyone is doing their best.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
I’m surprised this is the first time someone has requested that they write a novel using my manga. 

00:17.000 --> 00:19.500
Do they need my permission?

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Yes. If they use Aoi’s copyrighted works to create new ones,
they must obtain Aoi’s permission.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.000
Aoi, have you ever heard of the term “derivative work”?

00:33.500 --> 00:38.500
Derivative work? I don’t know.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
I’ll answer that for you. The Copyright Law
gives examples of various copyrighted works,

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
but it also defines a derivative work.

00:52.500 --> 01:00.500
Derivative works under Article 2(1)(xi) of the Copyright Law

01:01.000 --> 01:07.500
“The term ‘derivative work’ means a work

01:07.500 --> 01:12.500
that a person creates by translating, composing a musical arrangement of, reformulating, dramatizing,

01:12.500 --> 01:14.500
making a cinematographic adaptation of,
or otherwise adapting a pre-existing work.”

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
For derivative works, movies and manga based on novels
are the most famous.

01:21.500 --> 01:26.500
That’s right. This story falls under the category
of adaptations here since Aoi’s work is a manga,

01:26.500 --> 01:33.000
and they will write a novel based on it.

01:33.500 --> 01:40.000
I haven’t heard much about adaptation,
so, what does it refer to?

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Yes, I don’t think you hear that word very often in everyday life.

01:44.500 --> 01:52.000
The work from which the derivative work is derived is called the
original work and the adapted work is called a derivative work.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
An adaptation means creating another copyrighted work that can directly perceive the “essential characteristics

01:59.000 --> 02:07.500
of the expression of the original work” by modifying, increasing,
reducing, or altering the specific expressions.

02:08.500 --> 02:18.500
It can directly perceive the essential characteristics
of the expression...? It’s abstract.

02:18.500 --> 02:24.000
That’s right. First, to be recognized as a derivative work,

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
the identity of the “essential characteristics of the expression”
of the original work must be maintained.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.500
As we alter the original work in various ways,

02:34.500 --> 02:42.000
the identity of the essential characteristics of
the original work will no longer be maintained elsewhere.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.500
If the identity of the essential characteristics of the expression
is no longer maintained, it does not constitute a derivative work.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.500
If it’s not a derivative work, what is it?

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Suppose the identity of the essential characteristics of the
original work is no longer maintained.

03:02.000 --> 03:10.500
In that case, it is a new work that is different from the original
work if it has creativity.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.500
On the other hand, in addition to maintaining the identity of the
essential characteristics of the original work with new creativity, 

03:18.500 --> 03:23.000
it will be a derivative work.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.500
It isn’t easy to understand.
I wish it was explained a little more clearly.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Let me explain a specific example.

03:34.500 --> 03:43.000
This time, Aoi’s manga depicts the daily life and love
between the main character, a girl, and four boys.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
For example, what do you think would happen
to the copyright of a manga like this,

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
where only the abstract settings of the characters are the same, but the characteristics of the characters, such as their names

03:54.000 --> 03:58.500
and personalities, and the content of the descriptions of specific
scenes are entirely different?

04:00.000 --> 04:08.500
If the contents are entirely different, even though
the settings are the same, it is a different work, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:18.500
Yes. Even though the abstract settings of the persons are the
same, if the contents of the manga are entirely different,
it is a different work.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.500
Let’s say that some of the contents of the manga are the same.

04:23.500 --> 04:30.500
However, what if the same content remains based on common
expressions, historical facts, and data,

04:30.500 --> 04:36.000
and the content of other creative parts differs?

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
I have heard that common expressions and data are not
copyrighted works. Therefore, I think this is a different work.

04:44.000 --> 04:52.500
Yes. Since the contents of the creative parts are different,
in this case, they can be other works.

04:53.500 --> 05:00.500
Next, in addition to the specific setting of the characters drawn
in Aoi’s manga being the same,

05:00.500 --> 05:04.500
what about the copyrighted works that trace the portrayal of
various particular events

05:04.500 --> 05:08.500
and situations and the development
of stories?

05:09.000 --> 05:14.500
In that case, it would be a copyrighted work based on Aoi’s
manga.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.500
Yes. In this case, since the creative expression of Aoi’s manga
is maintained, 

05:21.500 --> 05:27.500
we can directly perceive the “essential characteristics
of the expression” of the original work.

05:28.500 --> 05:34.500
This time, we are turning the manga into a novel,
in other words, changing the form of expressions

05:34.500 --> 05:38.500
and adding creative expressions.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.500
In this case, it will be an ‘adaptation’ and a derivative work.

05:45.500 --> 05:54.000
I see. So, the key point is to see if Aoi’s manga’s creative
expression is maintained as in the novel.

05:54.500 --> 06:02.000
I’m starting to understand a little better what it means to directly
perceive the essential characteristics of an expression.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Here is the next point.

06:05.500 --> 06:12.000
A derivative work cannot be made without the permission from
the author of the original work.

06:12.500 --> 06:16.000
The Copyright Law states as follows.

06:16.500 --> 06:21.000
Article 27 (Translation Rights, Adaptation Rights,
and Other Rights)

06:21.000 --> 06:27.500
“The author of a work has the exclusive right to translate it,
compose a musical arrangement, reformulate it, dramatize it,

06:27.500 --> 06:33.500
make a cinematographic adaptation,
or otherwise adapt the work.”

06:34.000 --> 06:39.500
Okay. That’s why my friend asked me for permission.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.500
That’s right.

06:42.500 --> 06:48.500
What about the rights of derivative works that have been
licensed by the original author?

06:49.000 --> 06:53.500
Without the original work, no derivative work can be created.

06:54.000 --> 07:03.500
Therefore, in the case of derivative works, the rights are given
not only to the copyright owner of the derivative work,
but also to the copyright owner of the original work.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Specifically, the Copyright Law stipulates the following.

07:09.500 --> 07:15.000
Article 28 (Rights of the Original Author in Connection with the
Exploitation of a Derivative Work)

07:15.500 --> 07:22.500
“The author of the original work underlying a derivative work
holds exclusive rights in the same categories as the rights

07:22.500 --> 07:31.000
prescribed in this Subsection that the author of the derivative
work holds in connection with the exploitation of that derivative
work.”

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
For example, when using a derivative work, obtaining a license
from the copyright owners of the derivative work

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
and the original work is necessary.

07:43.500 --> 07:50.000
Now that you know this much, let’s look at the terms and
conditions of the novel submission site.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.500
Aoi, what were the conditions for submitting derivative works?

07:57.000 --> 08:01.500
It seems that the content is different on various posting sites.

08:02.000 --> 08:10.000
On this new website, when derivative works are posted,

08:10.000 --> 08:17.500
the consent of the copyright owner of the original work is
necessary.

08:17.500 --> 08:28.500
In addition, the author’s name of the original work is also
included in the author’s column of published novels as the
original author.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.500
In addition, if the original work has already been released to the
public, it seems necessary to post the public information as well.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.500
Yes, I think you get the gist of the situation now.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
In order to create a derivative work, permission from the
copyright owner of the original work is required.

08:53.500 --> 08:59.500
Each posting site has a different policy on how to confirm that.

09:00.500 --> 09:07.500
Based on what I researched, I think I was able to confirm
how the novel will be published.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
Based on this information Aoi, you may want to decide whether
or not you will allow your friend to turn your manga into a novel.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.500
Yes, I see. I’ll think about it.
