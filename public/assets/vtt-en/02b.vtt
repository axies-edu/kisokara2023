00:08.000 --> 00:13.500
Naoya, you seem confused after Kasumi reproached you.

00:13.500 --> 00:20.500
Yes. Everyone wants to see something that is interesting right?
I think it’s going to go viral!

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
That may be true. But is that what Kasumi wants? 

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
In that sense, it is correct that you checked with Kasumi
before uploading the video this time.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.500
If you had uploaded the video before getting Kasumi’s approval,
you would have infringed her copyright.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.000
Is that so?

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Yes. Now, let’s check the copyright.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I don’t know what went wrong...

00:53.000 --> 01:03.500
Copyrights include moral rights and economic rights.
In this section, we will focus on these economic rights.

01:03.500 --> 01:08.000
In addition to the right to reproduce a work,
there are various other economic rights,

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
such as the right to perform or show a play or movie, 

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
translate it, or add different forms of creative expression.

01:20.500 --> 01:26.000
Although economic rights belong to the author
of a work who first created it,

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
it is possible to assign all or part of these rights
to another person.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
The person who has these rights is called the copyright owner.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Here, we are concerned with one of these rights,
the public transmission right!

01:43.000 --> 01:46.500
The public transmission right?

01:46.500 --> 01:52.000
The public transmission right is the right
to transmit a work to the public,

01:52.000 --> 01:57.500
for example, by broadcasting over the airwaves
or distributing over the Internet.

01:57.500 --> 02:06.000
Here, the public in copyright law means an unspecified person
or a specific and large number of persons.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
The copyright owner of the work owns this right.
In this case, it’s Kasumi.

02:14.500 --> 02:21.000
Naoya attempted to show Kasumi’s video to unspecified persons.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.500
This constitutes an infringement of Kasumi’s public transmission right.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.500
I am not trying to make it go viral. I just wanted my followers to see it.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.500
So, if I’m going to upload it, I will do it by myself.

02:35.500 --> 02:47.500
I see. I assumed it was better to have a lot of people see it.
Indeed, I would have felt the same way as you if I were you. Sorry.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
What Naoya tried to do this time was
not only infringed the public transmission right

02:52.000 --> 02:56.700
but also infringed on other economic rights.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.500
Oh, there are others!

03:00.500 --> 03:09.000
Naoya downloaded the video data from the link sent to him
and tried to upload that file to Zwitter.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.700
Let’s think about this action.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
First, the copyright owner has a reproduction right
because downloading video data can be reproduced. 

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
In this case, Kasumi’s permission is required.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I downloaded what was sent to me. That’s not a problem, right?

03:28.000 --> 03:34.500
Yes, that’s right.
Next, uploading the data to Naoya’s Zwitter is

03:34.500 --> 03:39.000
related to the public transmission right, one of the economic rights. 

03:39.000 --> 03:49.000
The public transmission right is the right
to upload data to a server on the Internet
and make it available to an unspecified number of people.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.500
This is also a right that only the copyright owner, Kasumi, has.

03:53.500 --> 03:58.000
I see. So that’s where you’ve infringed on Kasumi’s rights.

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
Yes. Even if no one downloads it, the mere act of uploading is
an infringement of the public transmission right!

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
So, what do you think would happen
if someone other than the copyright owner

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
uploaded copyrighted material to social media
or a web page without permission?

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Hmm, I wonder...

04:23.000 --> 04:28.700
If everyone uploads without permission, 
you won’t have control over that copyrighted work, right?

04:28.700 --> 04:35.300
Yes. If someone is  uploading someone else’s copyrighted material
on the Internet, to view or download,

04:35.300 --> 04:42.500
the copyright owner will no longer be able to control or manage it.

04:42.500 --> 04:48.500
If it we a profitable work, there would be a lot of lost profits.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
To prevent this from happening,
the scope of use of copyrighted works

04:54.000 --> 04:58.500
should belong to the copyright owner who can decide and control it!

04:58.500 --> 05:02.000
Indeed, you’re right.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
So please think about public transmission and making transmittable
in the context of this case.

05:09.000 --> 05:19.000
Let’s see, the copyright owner of the video is the author, Kasumi.
The right to upload to the Internet or social media is the public transmission right.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.500
If you upload it, it will be transmitted to the public
so it’s not okay for me to upload it without permission.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.500
So, as long as I can talk to Kasumi and get her okay,
there won’t be a problem.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.000
Yes.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
But, even I thought it would be better to ask Kasumi
how she felt before sharing the video.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.200
That’s why I sent her a message.

05:40.200 --> 05:49.000
Yes, that’s true. But since we are friends,
I think about it as a matter of feelings,
but what if it had been between people we didn’t even know?

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
This is essentially a matter of social structures, laws, and contracts.
Don’t forget that.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.500
Yes! I understand!
