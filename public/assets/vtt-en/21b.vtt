00:08.000 --> 00:10.500
I’m sure you’re all struggling.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.500
Yes. I have heard that copying a copyrighted work for
private use is okay,

00:16.500 --> 00:20.500
but I have never confirmed the scope.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.500
Is it okay among friends?

00:23.500 --> 00:29.000
Now I’ll explain reproductions
for private use of copyrighted works.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
First, let’s look at the relevant Article.

00:34.500 --> 00:40.500
Article 30 (1) of the Copyright Law
(Reproduction for Private Use)

00:40.500 --> 00:45.500
“Except in the following cases, a user may reproduce a work
that is subject to copyright

00:45.500 --> 00:50.000
(hereinafter in this Subsection referred to as a “work”)

00:50.000 --> 00:58.000
if the reproduction is for personal or family use or for
any other use of a similarly limited scope.”

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
I will touch on this, “the following cases” a little later.

01:04.500 --> 01:12.500
Firstly, if you use it “for personal” or “family use or
for any other use of similarly limited scope,”

01:12.500 --> 01:20.000
you should understand that it is possible to reproduce it due to
this "reproduction for private use" right limitation.

01:20.500 --> 01:24.500
I don’t know if I can understand it.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.500
What do you mean by “for personal use”?

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
It is not for a job but for personal use, for example, a hobby.

01:36.000 --> 01:45.500
Also, when using it, the user must reproduce the copyrighted
work by themselves. This is a minor detail, but it's essential.

01:45.500 --> 01:53.000
I see. In this case, Aoi used it, so Aoi must reproduce it.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
Wait a minute. Before that, what does for family use and
other similarly limited scope mean?

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Is it okay between friends like us?

02:05.500 --> 02:10.000
Yes, that’s it. The Article has a genuinely vague expression.

02:10.500 --> 02:15.500
Family means within the same family.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.500
A limited scope equivalent to this does not have
an explicit criterion. 

02:23.500 --> 02:31.000
Still, it is said that a strong personal connection must be
established among the members.

02:31.500 --> 02:39.000
However, even in a large or small circle of people,
there may be no strong personal connection.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.500
For example, neighborhood associations,
are not considered to be applicable.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.500
Judicial precedents state that to be “for any other use of
a similarly limited scope,”

02:49.500 --> 02:58.000
“it is necessary to have an intimate and closed connection
at least to the extent equivalent to a family.”

02:59.000 --> 03:03.500
“For personal use” is surprisingly narrow.

03:03.500 --> 03:09.000
But we're very close, and it's just the three of us,
so I think we'll be okay.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
However, if it's based on family...it’s a little tricky.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.500
That’s right. I guess that’s what happens
if you interpret the Article literally.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.500
In this case, it’s difficult to say
whether it’s absolutely impossible.

03:22.500 --> 03:30.000
If Naoya had lent the book directly to Aoi instead of copying it,
there would have been no problem.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.500
Sure! I'll do that next time.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.500
Well, this time we’re talking about copying books,

03:37.500 --> 03:44.000
but I heard that things like character portraits and
downloading files are also considered copies.

03:44.500 --> 03:48.000
First of all, what does copying refer to?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.500
Kasumi, you made an excellent point.

03:51.500 --> 03:55.500
The voice has changed. Thank you very much.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Now, about reproductions.

03:58.500 --> 04:05.500
There are various reproductions available
depending on the copyrighted work.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.500
Reproduction includes printing books, magazines, and
other paper media you are familiar with on a copying machine.

04:14.000 --> 04:23.000
In addition, reproductions include converting to PDF
with a scanner, taking a photo, and taking a video.

04:23.500 --> 04:29.000
Oh, really? So, digitization is also a reproduction.

04:29.500 --> 04:36.500
I make PDFs of heavy books and carry them around,
but I shouldn't share them with anyone else right?

04:37.500 --> 04:45.500
That's right. There is no problem if you make PDFs for your use,
but you should not share them with others.

04:46.500 --> 04:51.000
In addition, because you can reproduce them for private use only,

04:51.000 --> 04:58.500
you cannot post them on social media or distribute them
to video-sharing websites for public transmission.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
Be careful!

05:00.500 --> 05:03.000
Yes, I understand.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.500
There are also a few exceptions.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.500
Reproduction by avoidance of technological protection;
Article 30(1)(ii) of the Copyright Law

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
Downloading from illegal sites,
Article 30(1)(iii) of the Copyright Law

05:20.500 --> 05:25.000
The first point is
“reproduction by avoiding technical protection measures.”

05:25.500 --> 05:29.000
Have you ever heard of copy protection?

05:29.500 --> 05:34.500
I've heard of it. I often watch movies on streaming sites,

05:34.500 --> 05:38.500
and some don't allow you to take screen captures.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.500
That's preventing copying, right?

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
Yes.

05:43.500 --> 05:51.000
You are not permitted to avoid copy protection
and reproduce such copy-protected works.

05:51.500 --> 05:57.500
Also, you cannot reproduce copy-protected works if you know
that you have copyrighted works that were created
by avoiding copy protection.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.500
I see.

05:59.500 --> 06:07.500
I cannot reproduce distributed movies
with copy protection for private use.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
That's right. Copy protection means you are not permitted
to reproduce in the first place,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.500
so do not make reproductions.

06:18.500 --> 06:23.000
Then, the next concerns “downloads from illegal sites.”

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Earlier, Kasumi said that downloads are also reproductions, right?

06:28.700 --> 06:35.500
You cannot reproduce the unauthorized downloads of illegally
distributed manga, books, newspapers, papers, software, etc.,

06:35.500 --> 06:41.000
for private use while knowing they are illegal.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
You may be subject to criminal penalties. Please be very careful.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.500
I see!

06:51.500 --> 06:57.000
You need to be especially careful with songs by artists
and TV shows from video-sharing websites!

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Everyone, please follow the rules
and use copyrighted material with care.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Yes! We understand.
