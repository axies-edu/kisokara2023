By the way, Aoi, you said there were some things you didn’t
understand in the Introduction to Statistics course.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.500
I made a copy of a book I had at home if you want to refer to it.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.500
Wow, thank you. That’s a big help.

00:40.500 --> 00:45.500
Hmm, that’s what I wanted to know. I finally understand.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.000
I’m glad it helped.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
This book explains difficult things in simple terms and has
many diagrams, making it easy to understand.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.500
Yeah. I think I’ll buy one too.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.000
Let me see.

01:05.500 --> 01:11.000
Oh? Come to think of it,
isn’t copying a book a copyright infringement?

01:11.000 --> 01:15.500
Oh, is that right? Isn’t it okay to photocopy for private use?

01:16.000 --> 01:19.500
Yes, if it is for private use.

01:19.500 --> 01:24.000
How far does private use extend?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.500
Is it okay among friends?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Hmm...
