00:04.700 --> 00:08.500
When I was a university student,

00:08.500 --> 00:14.700
I had a lot of opportunities to use citations in my reports,

00:14.700 --> 00:20.500
so I think you should be careful how you cite,

00:20.500 --> 00:27.000
because if you aren’t very careful, your university professors will warn you to be careful about infringing on the copyrights of others.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Also, I think the most familiar ones are social media posts;

00:33.500 --> 00:38.000
especially since the first thing that caught my attention was music.

00:38.000 --> 00:47.000
Since sometimes what you think is okay is not, I believe students should be careful about such things.






00:47.500 --> 00:56.000
My recommendation is the story about generative AI.

00:56.000 --> 01:12.000
Recently, AI has become increasingly popular, and AI paintings are increasingly used in advertising.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
So, in this story, we used a picture created by AI for the poster.

01:21.000 --> 01:31.000
I actually tried it, but was like, “what does this look like?”.
And I thought, “Isn’t it a little similar?”.

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
So, I guess that’s what I feel closest to. I’ve been taking this video since the end of September.

01:41.000 --> 01:53.000
Still, I think it will be helpful for students who want to use AI to make posters for various events, such as festivals in the fall and Christmas in the winter.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
I think it will be useful for those events.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
I think the topic of AI generation is a good one to talk about.

02:03.000 --> 02:13.500
For those of you who have just started watching, the theme of the previous videos is what copyright is in the first place.

02:13.500 --> 02:23.500
I think it’s a good starting point for those who, like me, know about copyright but don’t know what copyright is. 






02:24.500 --> 02:30.500
Last time, I talked about taking a picture of
a character lunch box and posting it on social media,

02:30.500 --> 02:37.500
but I think many people probably don’t know about that,
so, I would like them to see it.






02:38.200 --> 02:45.200
Yes, I have two concerns.

02:45.200 --> 02:49.000
The first is about how to cite in papers as I mentioned earlier.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.500
This is probably common among students, but I think citation is
quite difficult when you first try it.

02:53.500 --> 03:00.000
It’s not just about pulling sentences; and I think there are many
things you can’t understand without doing a lot of research,

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
so, I recommend it the most. Also, I think many young people
want to be YouTubers nowadays.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
In that sense, that is where copyright comes in.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
I learned about copyrights, portrait rights etc.
If you study the accompanying copyright material,

03:23.000 --> 03:33.500
you will probably understand and find that it is possible to have
fun doing this without getting caught up in copyright issues.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.700
I recommend those two videos in particular.





03:36.700 --> 03:40.500
After all, I felt a huge gap between
what everyone else was doing on social media

03:40.500 --> 03:47.500
and how much I thought was okay,

03:47.500 --> 03:52.000
so, I believe there are many things to see in that area.

03:52.000 --> 04:02.500
Also, I felt like I knew the meaning of movie warnings in
everyday life because I usually see them.

04:02.500 --> 04:07.000
Still, it was an opportunity to learn about them properly.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I think it’s essential to understand them,
so I also recommend that.
