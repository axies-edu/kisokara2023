Kasumi's lunch box looks fantastic! Who made it?

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
This? Mom's been into character lunch boxes lately
and said she's proud of them.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Your mom has good taste.
Can I take a picture and post it on my social media?

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Yup. This one's already out of copyright protection,
so that's okay.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
Do you mean the copyright of the rabbit in this lunch box?
Is this character lunch box related to copyright?

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Because I made my lunch box,
can't I also upload it to my social media?

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
But it seems to me that everyone usually does it.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
That's right. I was also curious, so I asked my professor about it.

00:59.000 --> 01:07.000
She said that even if it's a lunch box, it can be
a copyrighted work if copyright still exists.
You should be careful with famous characters etc.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
What's that? Does that mean we might be doing something
that violates copyright without even realizing it? That's scary!
