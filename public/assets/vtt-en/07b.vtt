Kasumi, I am surprised you noticed about the Terms of Use.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes. I wondered if posting them on social media
without permission would be appropriate,
even though they are free materials.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Caution is essential.

00:23.000 --> 00:34.000
In principle, it is necessary to obtain permission from the
copyright owner when using the copyrighted works of others,
such as illustrations, photographs, and music.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
On the other hand, many creators want their works to be used
by more people,

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
and there are an increasing number of cases where their works
are made available to the public for free or inexpensively.

00:47.000 --> 00:56.000
Most of these works are permitted for use while the copyright
owner retains the copyright.

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
Websites that make such works available to the public include
terms of use and precautions.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
It would be best to read through them before using copyrighted
works to ensure there are no problems with your usage.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
If you look at the website Aoi will use this time, you will find
a description in the “Terms of Use” section.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
According to that, you may be charged depending on
how you use it. Please check it carefully.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
I thought free materials meant free copyrights,
free costs, and no restrictions...no?

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Do you charge an admission fee for this band club concert?

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
If so, posters promoting it would also be considered
“commercial use,” so we need to check from that perspective.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
I see. Even though it’s free material, it’s not easy to use.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
It’s hard to find them because each site seems to have
a different place where they have them.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
Many websites for this kind of material describe it in
an easy-to-understand manner.

02:07.000 --> 02:18.000
I’m sure creators who have published their works will feel happy
to have them used like Aoi has done this time.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I hope so!

02:22.000 --> 02:33.000
There are various ways for copyright owners to express their
intentions regarding using copyrighted works, in addition to
terms of use such as this one.

02:33.000 --> 02:43.000
For example, game producers provide guidelines for using
“gameplay footage,” which has become a common sight.

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
In addition, copyright owners can use already proposed rules,
such as the Creative Commons license or the “Free Use Mark”
established by the Agency for Cultural Affairs in 2003,

02:51.000 --> 03:00.000
without having to create individual terms and guidelines for
each copyright owner.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
In computer software, various types of licenses have been proposed and used by software copyright owners,

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
such as the BSD license, the MIT license, and the GPL.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
Each of these licenses is proposed with a different philosophy
and has differences.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
It is interesting to examine them in detail if you are interested.

03:26.000 --> 03:36.000
In any case, the copyright owner is providing you with
copyrighted works they have spent time and money creating.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Please comply with the terms of use and licenses and use
the copyrighted works with gratitude.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes. I should at least get into the habit of reading
the Terms of Use first!

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I understand.
