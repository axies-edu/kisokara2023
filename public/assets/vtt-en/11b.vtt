00:07.500 --> 00:16.000
You are all doing well! Now, let me explain the copyright
procedures for the school festival stage. 

00:16.000 --> 00:19.500
Let’s start by checking with music.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.000
Aoi, what kind of precautions are necessary
when performing music?

00:25.000 --> 00:33.500
Yes. We have no problem performing songs we have written
ourselves since we own the copyright.

00:33.500 --> 00:38.500
However, if we want to perform a song written by a professional
at a concert,

00:38.500 --> 00:44.500
the song is the copyrighted work of another person.
Then, we must obtain a license to use the song.

00:44.500 --> 00:56.000
Specifically, the concert organizer must contact a copyright
management society such as JASRAC and pay a royalty fee.

00:56.500 --> 01:02.500
That’s right. How about this school festival?

01:02.500 --> 01:09.000
There is no admission fee for this school festival, and the stage
events are free of charge.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Therefore, we don’t need to obtain a license.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes. This is called “non-profit performance.”

01:21.000 --> 01:29.500
It is not for profit, and no fee is received from the audience or
spectators. No remuneration is paid to the performers.

01:29.500 --> 01:36.000
If the three requirements are met, you can use a copyrighted
work without obtaining permission,

01:37.500 --> 01:43.000
so it is not only limited to educational use.

01:43.500 --> 01:49.000
The purpose of the copyright system is to contribute to the
development of culture.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.500
Therefore, from the viewpoint of fair and smooth exploitation of
 works
that are cultural products,

01:55.500 --> 02:02.000
the system restricts some of the authors’ rights and stipulates cases where users can use copyrighted works without permission.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
You mean that the music used by the dance club and the play
written by the drama club do not need permission if it is a free
school festival, right?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Yes. The same thing applies.

02:13.000 --> 02:21.500
However, the author’s “moral rights” are not limited
even in the case of free performances,

02:21.500 --> 02:28.000
so you should be careful when editing the music
or altering the script.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.500
That’s why the executive committee’s manual requires

02:31.500 --> 02:39.000
each group to check to see if there are any edits to the music
played on stage or alterations to the scripts of plays.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
What will happen regarding e-sports?

02:43.000 --> 02:47.500
As for e-sports, let me explain. As a game enthusiast,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
the same concept can apply to computer games used for e-sports,

02:52.000 --> 02:58.500
basically as ‘non-profit performances, etc.’

02:58.500 --> 03:04.500
However, depending on the game title, there are many cases

03:04.500 --> 03:10.000
where the game software makers have established rules and
policies for holding competitions in their terms of use.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
I may have to have the e-sports club check
the game’s terms of use.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
We don’t know much about e-sports as it’s a new proposition.
We should do some research, too.

03:24.500 --> 03:32.000
Also, Kasumi, you mentioned that since we are an educational
institution, we do not need the copyright owner’s permission.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.500
However, Article 35 of the Copyright Law states, “exploitation
in the course of those classes.”

03:40.500 --> 03:45.000
Please note that unlike cultural festivals held as part of classes
up to high school,

03:45.000 --> 03:50.500
university school festivals do not fall under this category.

03:51.500 --> 03:58.500
I see. High school festivals and college festivals are different.
I understand!
