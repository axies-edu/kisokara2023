Hey, what are you doing? Let me join you.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.500
Great.
I’m working on questions for a programming contest right now.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.500
Programming? Naoya is someone who can do such things!?

00:21.500 --> 00:25.000
Nowadays, even elementary school students are programming!

00:25.000 --> 00:28.500
I studied so hard that I could do it for my part-time job as a tutor.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.500
This is a programming contest
for junior high and high school students,

00:32.500 --> 00:37.000
to take up the challenge of the questions posted on a website.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Recently, programs using artificial intelligence have become
more commonplace,

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
so I’m considering making it so that you can input existing lyrics
to a song and automatically generate a parody version of them.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.500
Yes, artificial intelligence!

00:51.000 --> 00:58.500
Hmm, so, this English song is the subject material.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.500
I’d like to include songs everyone knows,
but there are also copyright issues.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.500
Tyson, an acquaintance of Kasumi, suggested this song to me.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.500
Tyson says this kind of usage is acceptable

01:09.500 --> 01:14.000
because it’s fair use as defined by the US Copyright Law,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.500
but there’s no such fair use in Japan.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.000
So, I looked up the author just in case,

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
and I was just saying, it should be okay
because he’s been dead for 75 years.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.500
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:28.500 --> 01:33.000
You always look so worried. What’s wrong?

01:33.500 --> 01:38.000
I wanted to use this song under fair use in the US.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.500
However, since we do not have fair use in Japan,
we looked into the protection period for copyright.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.500
That seems okay, but is that enough?

01:45.500 --> 01:47.000
That’s what you are talking about.

01:47.500 --> 01:52.000
It’s generally good, but there’s one more thing.
You should be careful.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
What? Is there something else?

01:54.500 --> 01:57.500
I’d better explain this properly.

01:57.500 --> 02:03.500
However, I don’t have much time now as I have a meeting,
so can you wait until after that?

02:03.500 --> 02:06.000
Understood. We’ll be waiting.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Okay, I’ll be back after the meeting.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
