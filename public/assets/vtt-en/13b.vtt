00:08.500 --> 00:12.500
It’s well known that you can upload music to YouTube.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
This page of JASRAC says that

00:17.000 --> 00:21.500
“your own musical performances” can be uploaded
without any procedures.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Does that mean that what we played ourselves is okay?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
The dance club’s song is the same but they used a downloaded
version, right?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
What is the “neighboring right owner”
you were talking about earlier?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
I’ve only just heard of it.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I’ll explain it to you. 

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
The rights under the Copyright Law

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
are broadly divided into copyrights, the authors’ rights, and
neighboring rights, which are the rights of performers, etc.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Performers are singers, actors, theater directors,
and other people

01:02.000 --> 01:06.500
who are responsible for communicating copyrighted works
to the public. 

01:07.500 --> 01:16.000
Although the performer has not created copyrighted works,
communicating them has “neighboring rights.”

01:16.500 --> 01:23.500
It is not the same as the copyright, but it will have the rights
shown in the diagram.

01:23.500 --> 01:29.000
The person who has neighboring rights is the
“neighboring right owner.”

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
I see that in the case of music, the singer becomes the performer
and has neighboring rights.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
And when you upload it to YouTube, you need
the performer’s permission, right?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
That’s right. 

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
In the case of music, the rights involved are shown
in the red text. 

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
The band club “performed” at the university festival.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
The composer, who is the copyright owner, holds the musical
performance right,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
so it is necessary to obtain the composer’s permission.

02:07.500 --> 02:14.000
However, the university festival was a non-profit performance,
so it was okay without permission.

02:14.500 --> 02:23.500
When uploading to YouTube this time, in addition to that,
you need to reproduce and publicly transmit the video.

02:23.500 --> 02:32.000
For many songs, the scope of these rights is managed
by JASRAC of the management society, etc.

02:32.500 --> 02:39.500
According to the website Ryota mentioned earlier, YouTube has a
comprehensive license agreement with JASRAC,

02:39.500 --> 02:47.500
and they have licenses on behalf of the users who upload music
to the website.

02:48.500 --> 02:53.500
The best thing about it is that you can upload your own
“musical performances” without any procedures.

02:54.500 --> 03:03.000
That’s right. However, JASRAC and other copyright management
societies do not manage some songs.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.500
In that case, please be aware that
you need to do the procedure yourself.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.500
I’ll explain from here, as a music lover. 

03:14.500 --> 03:20.000
You can upload “your own musical performances”
without any procedures. 

03:20.000 --> 03:26.500
However, the dance club used the music recorded by singers,
which the record companies sold.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Since we are using it, if we don’t do it correctly,
there is a possibility that this could result in an infringement of

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
the “performer’s right” and the “record producer’s right,”
which are one of the neighboring rights. 

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
JASRAC does not manage them.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
So, the singers/record companies are the neighboring rights
owners, and you must get their permission to upload to YouTube.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.500
Come to think of it, I wonder if the instrument players also
become performers?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
It’s complicated.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
In many cases, it seems that the performers’ rights are also
assigned to the record labels,

04:09.000 --> 04:14.500
that produced the record, or even if they are not assigned,
the record companies manage them.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.500
In this case, I need permission from Sunny Music,
which publishes this song.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.000
I’ll look up the contact details right away.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
That’s a very good idea.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
It’s important to know that if you want to use someone’s
copyrighted work, don’t give up

04:31.000 --> 04:34.500
because you can’t use it without permission, because you only
need to ask for permission to use it.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.500
First, you should look for the copyright owner and neighboring rights owner,

04:40.000 --> 04:46.500
specify the purpose, period of use, etc., and apply for a license.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.500
Understood!
