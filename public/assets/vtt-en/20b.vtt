00:08.000 --> 00:15.500
When shooting photos or videos, the logo, characters,
or pictures of celebrities may appear in them.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.500
There are signs and ads everywhere.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
This time, the character from the poster was in the video,
and that seems to be illegal.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.500
Yes. It was a bit careless. I’m planning to upload this video
to the website. Is there any problem with that?

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
For copying posters and other works like this one,

00:40.000 --> 00:46.500
the provisions concerning the “Exploitation of Incidentally
Captured Works” that limit copyright shall apply.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.500
Exploitation of Incidentally Captured Works?

00:53.500 --> 01:04.000
In short, incidentally captured works mean another copyrighted
work, such as works captured in photographs. 

01:04.500 --> 01:10.000
As the Article says incidentally,
it is necessary to shoot with the main subject  

01:10.000 --> 01:14.500
rather than shoot with the aim of capturing copyrighted work.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
In this case, the main focus of the video is on the person working,
which is considered incidentally captured work.

01:23.500 --> 01:31.000
If the scene’s purpose is to make the lab poster mainly
recognizable, it will not be incidental.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.500
I see. This time, the angle was focused on the worker,
so that was good.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
I’m relieved. Incidentally captured works, I should remember this!

01:46.000 --> 01:51.500
When does this provision apply as the exploitation of incidentally
captured works?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.500
Yes, let’s touch on that point now.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.500
Requirements for captured works

02:01.000 --> 02:05.500
The copyrighted work should be incidentally captured with the
main subject.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.500
The captured copyrighted work should remain a minor part.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.500
The exploitation is within a reasonable scope.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
The interests of the copyright owner
shall not be unreasonably prejudiced.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
It’s pretty abstract...

02:24.000 --> 02:27.500
I’ll explain what it means, including that.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.000
A woman is speaking.

02:30.500 --> 02:37.500
Firstly, let’s look at cases where the Article applies.

02:38.500 --> 02:44.500
The Article of the Copyright Law includes

02:44.500 --> 02:55.500
“the act of taking a photograph, making a sound recording, broadcasting, or otherwise reproducing the image or sound of a subject matter, or transmitting it without reproduction.”

02:57.000 --> 03:05.500
In other words, the Article applies to photographs and video
shoots and situations such as live streaming on YouTube.

03:05.500 --> 03:10.000
The Article also applies to screenshots taken on PC screens.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Hmm, so, it applies to YouTube live streaming too.

03:16.500 --> 03:28.000
Yes. For example, when shooting a video on the street and music
from a nearby store is also in the video, will be no problem.

03:28.500 --> 03:38.000
More specifically, it includes not only those situations where
creativity is recognized but also those where creativity is not
recognized, 

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
such as photography with fixed cameras.

03:42.500 --> 03:50.500
What is the third requirement for captured works, within a just scope?

03:50.500 --> 03:54.500
I was thinking that it was very abstract.

03:55.500 --> 04:02.000
Within a just scope shall be determined in light of factors
such as whether or not

04:02.000 --> 04:09.500
there is an intention to obtain profits from the use of
a copyrighted work.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.500
The decision will be made based on factors such as the role of the copyrighted work, and the degree of difficulty in separating it.

04:13.500 --> 04:21.500
Specifically, in order to prevent people from intentionally including copyrighted material in works in order to obtain economic profits, evaluations are made in light of various factors,

04:21.500 --> 04:24.500
such as whether there is any profit-making intent behind the use of the captured copyrighted works.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.500
For example, to attract viewers’ interest in online distribution,

04:29.500 --> 04:38.500
it is unlikely that intentionally displaying famous or well-known
characters in a scene will be accepted as just scope.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.500
Ah, that’s what I’m talking about. I understand.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.500
Finally, I will explain that copyright owners’ interests are not
unreasonably prejudiced.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
The act of not unreasonably prejudicing the interests of the copyright owner shall be determined

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
in light of the type and use of the copyrighted work and the
manner of its use.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.500
For example, suppose the work captured in a photo was a
valuable piece,

05:05.500 --> 05:12.000
even if the image is a reflection, if the use of the image causes economic damage to the copyright owner,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
it may be judged that the copyright owner’s interests were
unreasonably prejudiced.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.000
The use of copyrighted works is permitted only to the extent that 

05:21.000 --> 05:28.500
it does not unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright
owner, so you must be careful.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides examples of
“captured work” of copyrighted works

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
that do not require copyright owners’ licensing and those where you need to obtain a license. 

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Please check out the contents too.

05:43.500 --> 05:50.500
So, if I want to use the photos and videos I took,
are there any requirements?

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
Photographs, etc., containing the incidentally captured works
may be used without any restrictions.

05:59.500 --> 06:05.000
However, this is also limited to cases that do not prejudice the
interests of copyright owners.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
This time, the main focus was on the work scene, so there was
no problem with the characters appearing in the picture, 

06:12.000 --> 06:15.500
and it was okay to release a video introducing the lab.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.000
Yes, no problem.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
It’s good.
Actually, the person I asked to attend is a bit of a scary person.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.000
I was afraid of what they would say if we had to reshoot.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.500
Good for you!

06:31.000 --> 06:35.500
I learned a lot as a result. Thank me for noticing!

06:35.500 --> 06:37.000
Yeah. I guess so.
Mm-hmm.
