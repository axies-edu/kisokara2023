By the way, I told you before that when I went to see a movie,
there was a film warning against illegal recording and
downloading.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I mentioned before that the penalties include fines and
imprisonment, right?

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes. What about it?

00:25.000 --> 00:32.500
It just occurred to me that the revenue from that fine
will not go to the copyright owner.

00:32.500 --> 00:41.500
Even if there is a jail sentence, copyright owners can get
nothing. I guess there’s no other way but to accept it right?

00:41.500 --> 00:49.000
Come to think of it, I remember when the movie companies sued
people who edited movies by making them shorter and posted
them on video posting sites.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.500
It is true that if someone shortens a movie without permission,
the story will be harder to understand,

00:55.500 --> 01:01.000
and if that video reduces the number of people who will see
the original film, the creator will be shocked.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
That’s right. Regarding that trial, I saw an article about a court
judgment that awarded hundreds of millions of yen in damages.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.000
Ah, here it is.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Can ordinary people afford hundreds of millions of yen?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
But wait a minute. 

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Wasn’t copyright infringement a 10 million yen fine?

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
I think litigation would be complicated.
I’ll ask my professor when I go to school.
