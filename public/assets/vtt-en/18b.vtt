00:08.000 --> 00:12.500
Sorry for keeping you waiting. Have you resolved it then?

00:14.000 --> 00:19.500
I’ve been looking into it since then,
but I can’t think of another one...

00:19.500 --> 00:22.500
Yes, it’s a little special.

00:22.500 --> 00:29.500
There are several international conventions on copyright,
such as the Berne Convention.

00:29.500 --> 00:34.500
Each country member of these conventions is supposed to protect each other’s copyrighted works

00:35.500 --> 00:39.000
in the same way they do in their own countries.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.500
I’ve only heard of the Berne Convention.
How many countries are members?

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
181 countries.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
So many? It’s a significant convention!

00:51.500 --> 00:55.500
But are there that many countries in the world?

00:55.500 --> 01:01.000
Come on, what are you talking about? Even I know that.
I know there’re about 200 countries in the world.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
There are currently 196 countries.
That’s why it’s a convention that most countries are members of.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.500
Yes, I will explain about the Convention.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.500
The Berne Convention is
an international Convention on copyright,

01:17.500 --> 01:24.000
in which the works of citizens of a country that is a party to the
Convention are protected by all member countries.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.000
It means that Japan protects the music of foreign composers.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
That’s right. The primary content of the Convention is like this.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
The first is the principle of automatic protection,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.500
which means that “music by foreign composers,”
as Kasumi mentioned earlier,

01:44.500 --> 01:47.500
does not need to be registered in any way
to be protected in Japan.

01:49.500 --> 01:53.000
That’s what the Japanese Copyright Law was originally about,
right?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
You’re studying well.

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
The Copyright Law was enacted in Japan in 1899,
and the Berne Convention was signed simultaneously,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.500
so, I think the system was adopted then.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.000
The second is national treatment.

02:10.500 --> 02:16.500
The Berne Convention signatory states must also give
citizens of other convention signatories equal

02:16.500 --> 02:21.500
or greater protection than the copyright protection
for their citizens.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.500
The third, protection term is for when the author is still alive,
and the copyright must be guaranteed 50 years after death. 

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
They cleared it for 70 years after death in accordance
with Japanese and American domestic laws.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Fair use in the United States, which has been a hot topic,

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
is fair and can be used without the copyright owner’s license
for things

02:49.000 --> 02:52.500
that do not unfairly harm the copyright owner’s interest.

02:52.500 --> 02:58.000
The Japanese Copyright Law does not have fair use,
so it doesn’t apply in Japan. 

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
Conversely however, fair use can apply to Japanese copyrighted
works in the United States.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.500
I see. So, it seems like everything is okay just as
Kasumi and Naoya found out.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.500
What did you mean when you said earlier that further
consideration is needed?

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
For older works in the United States and the United Kingdom,

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
it is sometimes necessary to consider “wartime extensions.”

03:25.500 --> 03:30.000
I’ve never heard of wartime extensions.

03:30.500 --> 03:35.500
During World War II, Japan and the U.S. were enemies, right?

03:35.500 --> 03:42.500
That’s why it’s been said that American works were
not protected in Japan during that time.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.500
For this reason, a system that seeks to recover the benefits of copyright owners lost in the war

03:48.500 --> 03:55.500
by adding that period to the ordinary copyright protection term is called “wartime extensions.”

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Ah, it’s a bit complicated.

03:59.000 --> 04:08.000
If the copyrighted works of the enemy countries are not
protected during the war, then it seems that we are both
in the same situation.

04:08.500 --> 04:14.000
In fact, various organizations are campaigning
to abolish this system.

04:14.500 --> 04:20.500
I see. In the case of this song, it’s been 75 years since the
composer died. However,

04:20.500 --> 04:25.000
considering wartime extensions,
it’s still under copyright protection.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
That’s too bad. But if that’s the current rule,
then nothing can be done about it.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah, I guess so. Let’s give up and find a different song.
