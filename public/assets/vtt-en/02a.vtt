It’s done! I struggled with the last part,
but it turned out well. 

00:24.000 --> 00:29.500
Since I have the chance, I’ll have Aoi and Naoya look at it
before it’s released to the public.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
This video is hilarious!

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes! If it’s this funny, everyone should see it.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
I have a lot of followers, so if I download the video
and upload it to Zwitter, I can get it to go viral. 

01:34.000 --> 01:37.500
I’ll ask Kasumi about that zweet. 

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Well, I’m going to bed.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
What’s this? What does this mean?

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000


02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Hello, that was a great video. I was very impressed.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
Thank you, but I didn’t mean that.
I’m talking about uploading it to Zwitter.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Ah! That’s what I wanted to talk to you about, too! It was terrific,
so I wanted everyone to see it!

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
I’m glad you feel that way, but please stop uploading zweets...

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
That was my creation, and I’ll decide who gets to see it.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.500
Eh, why??
