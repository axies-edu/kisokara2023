00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Well, I guess it should be okay like this.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.500
Naoya, you look like you’re having a hard time.
What are you doing?

00:19.500 --> 00:24.500
Kasumi, I’m making a poster for an upcoming event in my club.

00:24.500 --> 00:29.000
I asked Aoi to do it, but she refused because she was busy.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
That’s why you’re drawing the poster yourself.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.500
It looks pretty good. Wait, can you draw, Naoya?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.700
No, not at all.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.500
Then what happened to this drawing?

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Generative AI is very popular these days, right?
That’s what I’m using.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
You can specify the content of the drawing you want it to draw,
and it will create an image for you to match that.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.500
See, like this.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.500
Wow, that’s interesting.

01:04.500 --> 01:09.000
Though I’m not an artist,
I thought I could make a poster with this.

01:09.500 --> 01:16.500
In any case, the terms of use allow AI-generated images to be
used commercially or for the purpose of attracting customers.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.500
Come to think of it, something like this came up in our
Data Science and AI classes.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.700
The professor said that by collecting a large number of pictures
and drawings and having AI learn from them,

01:27.700 --> 01:30.700
it is now possible to have AI draw pictures.
It’s amazing how suddenly something like this can be created.

01:30.700 --> 01:35.000
It seems that AI can imitate the style of old painters
or something like that.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
But I feel like I’ve seen this picture somewhere before.

01:40.500 --> 01:45.000
Really? I didn’t give any special instructions.

01:55.500 --> 02:01.000
Look at this. Don’t they look exactly like the people
in this picture, like how they dress and the composition?

02:01.500 --> 02:04.500
It’s true, they look alike.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.500
This is an album cover of an old CD,
and it seems to be quite famous.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.500
Isn’t it bad to put this poster up or show it on the Internet?
It might infringe copyright.

02:14.500 --> 02:19.000
What? Why?
I didn’t use this cover illustration as the source material.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.500
I just entered a few keywords and specified what kind of picture
I wanted.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Hmm...

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Here’s something.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.500
He came out without being called.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.500
This AI used to create the image by Naoya
is called generative AI,

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
and it can learn from text, images, videos, and music. 

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Based on these, it can create new things.

02:51.500 --> 02:55.500
Until now, only people can make such things,

02:55.500 --> 03:03.000
and the things they created have been treated as copyrighted
works and protected by copyright.

03:04.500 --> 03:14.000
 Currently, there are various discussions on how creations by AI
will be treated in the future and the relationship between AI and
copyright. 

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
There are several requirements and standards for copyright infringement.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
Oh, it’s a woman this time.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
Yes, I will explain the details.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.500
These are the requirements and standards for copyright
infringement.

03:32.500 --> 03:39.000
It requires two conditions: (1) similarity and (2) access.

03:39.500 --> 03:47.500
Similarity means that it is similar, mainly that the creative
expressions of the copyrighted work are used.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.500
Access is based on existing works.

03:53.500 --> 03:58.500
These have been used as criteria for copyright infringement
in the past,

03:58.500 --> 04:05.500
and it is believed that the treatment of AI paintings will remain
the same as human paintings.

04:06.500 --> 04:14.500
As Kasumi pointed out, the similarity with existing works will
likely be an issue.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
It may be challenging to judge access as well.

04:20.500 --> 04:28.000
For example, to create this AI image, it may be related
to whether the illustration of the CD cover,

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
which was thought to be similar, was used as learning data.

04:33.500 --> 04:37.500
Actually, I didn’t know about the CD cover,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
so it’s not an imitation or a copy.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.000
I just gave instructions for my image to AI,
and it came out similar.

04:45.500 --> 04:50.500
I know Naoya didn’t copy it, and I guess it’s just a coincidence...

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
There may be some idea that AI has imitated.

04:54.500 --> 05:00.000
AI learns from pictures and photographs created by humans
and then creates an image from them, right?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
What if it contains copyrighted material in it...?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
That may be true,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
but you can’t be really sure that the AI actually imitated it, right?

05:10.000 --> 05:17.500
Maybe. So, I think it might be a bad idea to show this drawing,
but I can’t say for sure that it’s not possible.

05:17.500 --> 05:23.000
Hmm, I see. Then, I guess I should give up on this drawing.

05:23.500 --> 05:30.000
But I don’t think it’s possible to create something that
doesn’tresemble any picture that exists in the world.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.500
It’s true. It’s impossible, or rather, it’s not clear in many ways.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.500
How should we think about this?

05:37.500 --> 05:42.000
Since copyright is a right stipulated by law,

05:42.000 --> 05:49.500
the final judgment of a copyright infringement will be rendered
through legal discussions and court proceedings.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
This is a process that takes a long time with experts.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.500
Therefore, it is almost impossible for the public to properly judge
and resolve whether there is copyright infringement.

06:05.500 --> 06:11.500
In addition,
apart from whether or not it is a copyright infringement,

06:11.500 --> 06:17.500
there are also many cases, especially on the Internet,
in which works that are similar to other people’s works,

06:17.500 --> 06:21.500
are suspected of being plagiarisms
and thereby create a backlash online.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
These are problems that have existed for a long time.

06:25.500 --> 06:32.500
It seems that new issues are emerging

06:32.500 --> 06:38.000
because it has become possible to generate paintings
and other creations using AI,

06:38.000 --> 06:43.500
but whether you draw a picture by hand or use AI to create an
image, considering the possibility of copyright infringement,

06:43.500 --> 06:47.500
the idea of what should be done should not change significantly
from before.

06:48.500 --> 06:55.500
If a picture drawn by you or an image generated by AI
is similar to another person’s work; 

06:55.500 --> 07:03.000
in order to avoid any trouble such as online backlash,
a safe and rational choice would be to not make it public.

07:03.500 --> 07:07.500
This is a judgment based on a different standard from the law.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.500
Furthermore, there are ongoing discussions about the handling
and role of AI within society.

07:16.500 --> 07:22.700
The thinking on AI creations may change in the future.

07:22.700 --> 07:30.000
Therefore, it is better to pay attention to such trends in discussions and amendments to the Copyright Law.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.500
Yes, we got it!
