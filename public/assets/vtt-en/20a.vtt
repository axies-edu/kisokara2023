Hi.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Hi, Ryota, what’s wrong?

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Do you have a minute?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
I’m going to make a video to introduce my lab.

00:25.500 --> 00:29.000
So, I was wondering if you could help me.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Sure, okay!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.500
Of course, I’ll also help you.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.000
Thank you very much. That helps.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.500
How is it going right now?

00:38.500 --> 00:41.000
We’ve just begun editing.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
I’ve taken a video of the work being done by my colleagues
in the lab.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.000
This is it...

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Programming?

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Huh, stop for a second. Ryota, is this scene, okay?

01:17.500 --> 01:19.000
Which one?

01:19.500 --> 01:21.000
Here it is.

01:23.500 --> 01:31.000
Huh? You mean this poster? Ah, I see!

01:31.000 --> 01:34.500
Yes, characters are used in the poster, right?

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Ah, I was not aware of that! That character is copyrighted!

01:39.500 --> 01:45.000
That was so careless... Aoi, you noticed that well.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.500
Really. You are usually quite ditzy.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.000
Excuse me! This is the way I’m supposed to be!

01:51.000 --> 01:54.500
Okay. Okay. So, how do you get this character in the video?

01:54.500 --> 01:59.000
Huh? Well, I don’t know about that.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, that’s just like the normal Aoi.

02:03.500 --> 02:10.000
It’s no laughing matter! I don’t know what to do with this.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.500
It might be better to take a new video.
