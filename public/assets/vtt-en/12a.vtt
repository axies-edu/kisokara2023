It’s hard to come up with good ideas!
The deadline for poster proposals is next week!　

00:17.000 --> 00:19.500
Is everyone thinking of something?

00:19.500 --> 00:23.500
This year’s school festival theme is
"Every cloud has a silver lining."

00:23.500 --> 00:29.000
If we can overcome this challenge, I wonder
if we will have a fun school festival under the blue sky.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.500
"Every cloud has a silver lining" sounds like something a
character in a manga would say, doesn’t it?

00:36.500 --> 00:43.000
Let the character appear on the poster with a speech balloon
saying, "Every cloud has a silver lining"! Is this not possible?

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
If the character is unacceptable, how about casually using
a sword, a costume, or other partial items?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.500
Just borrow a motif.

00:53.500 --> 00:58.000
Motifs...or something better from a different angle.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.000
Every cloud has a silver lining…

01:05.500 --> 01:10.500
This picture of the blue sky and meadows might be an
"Every cloud has a silver lining" kind of picture.

01:10.500 --> 01:17.000
Put the university’s mascot character on a picture like this...

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
I have an idea! Have the mascot character wear a kimono
that resembles the manga.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Since we’re not using the character directly,
that should work, right?

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
I know it’s my fault,
but isn’t your head totally full of that manga?


01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
But I often see a lot of works on the Internet based on popular
manga.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I wonder what the copyrights are for those...

01:43.000 --> 01:49.500
Can we use things like the university mascot character,
or the university emblem, without permission?

01:49.500 --> 01:54.000
Is it okay if it’s a poster for a school festival?
There seem to be some rules.
