The materials this time are based on the theme of school
festivals, and the previous one also had a theme of citations
in university reports.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
It’s amazing; I think it explains copyright in a way that is easy to
understand, using things that are familiar to university students
as teaching materials.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.500
I hope you will take a look at this and learn something that will be
useful for your school life.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.000
Thank you very much.





00:30.500 --> 00:36.000
Once again, my name is Ryusei Ishida, and I played the role of Naoya.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.500
To all the students watching this, the content is going to be very challenging but it is definitely something that is close to us.

00:43.500 --> 00:52.500
Although it is called copyright; it is a law, so, it will be a shock to you

00:52.500 --> 00:59.500
when you later realize that you have been living your life and have violated it without even noticing.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.700
That’s why we made these videos, and now that you are watching them, I hope you will be able to apply them in real life.

01:04.700 --> 01:10.000
I, too, have been in the same position as these students.

01:10.000 --> 01:19.500
When I watched the videos from the first to the last and thought back to the times when I did things like this or that,

01:19.500 --> 01:30.000
or when I did stuff like this in high school, I was surprised to find that some of the things I did may not have been so good.

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
or when I did stuff like this in high school, I was surprised to find that some of the things I did may not have been so good.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
So, let’s not make the same mistakes. Let’s respect copyrights and live a happy life together.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.500
Thank you.







01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
I hope these videos will be of some help to you
in your studies and such.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Well, it might be a little difficult. I don’t know what to say.








02:13.500 --> 02:21.500
Throughout these videos on copyright, I realized that there were
so many things that I didn’t know or understand at all.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.500
Still, when I watched them, I realized how important copyright is.

02:27.500 --> 02:35.500
I believe that students will have more and more opportunities
to learn about citations and copyrights,

02:35.500 --> 02:41.500
so I hope you will take this opportunity to watch and study
these videos and use them in the future.









02:42.500 --> 02:46.500
Well, compared to when I was a student;

02:46.500 --> 02:52.500
social media and the Internet are much more accessible
and familiar to us now.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.700
I think that many things that were considered normal and safe
for our generation and that of students’ parents,

02:59.700 --> 03:03.500
are things you have to be careful of now.

03:03.500 --> 03:09.000
I think there are a lot of things that we have to think about
very closely.

03:09.500 --> 03:16.500
I hope these videos will make your life more enjoyable.
