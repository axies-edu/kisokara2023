00:08.500 --> 00:12.000
With this soccer boom, a movie about soccer was also released.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.900
Yes! The other day, I went to a movie theater for the first time in a while. 

00:16.000 --> 00:23.500
Before the movie I wanted to see started, 
there was a video warning against unauthorized recording and illegal downloading.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I’ve seen it too. It’s a crime! You get fined or imprisoned! Something like that, right?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah. I was a bit surprised by the severe penalties.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.500
I understand the need for laws, but why must we regulate so harshly?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Isn’t there a lot of damage caused by the illegal downloading of movies?

00:43.000 --> 00:49.500
Speaking of downloading, we were asked to download software　
to our computers for an exercise in my last programming class.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
However, it was free and publicly available, so I downloaded it right away. 

00:53.500 --> 00:59.500
What’s the difference between an illegal download, 
like a movie, and software that can be downloaded for free?

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Software...
How can it be free when it certainly took a lot of work for the people who made it?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.500
By the way, Professor Uchida’s class materials were also made available to the public for free.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
It’s very generous.
Okay, let’s go ask the professor.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Ah, maybe I don’t need to go that far, but...

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
The sooner we figure it out, the better off we’ll be. Come on, let’s go.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Naoya, too.
Oh, yeah.
