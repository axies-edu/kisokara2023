00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Aoi, Naoya, you seem to be confused.

00:11.000 --> 00:18.000
I am surprised. I see character lunch boxes everywhere,
but are they illegal?

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Enjoying your work with those close to you is fine
without uploading it to social media.

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
However, uploading to social media, if an unspecified person
or a large number of people can view it,

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
is an infringement of the public transmission right,
so you must be very careful in handling your copyrighted work.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
It’s illegal even if I make my lunch!

00:43.000 --> 00:52.000
Aoi, copyright arises for the creative expression of ideas
and feelings, right?

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
Even if you made the lunch box itself and what is expressed in it
is a protected copyrighted work, it is an infringement.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Even if you expressed it in your lunch box, it is no different
than drawing a character’s portrait.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
In other words, you have reproduced it, which infringes
the reproduction right.

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
Therefore, you should not upload it to social media and
transmit it publicly.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
I see. I think the person who made it just wanted people to see it
because it was well made but that is still unacceptable.

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
But now I think there are images of character lunch boxes on the
internet in many places. Aren’t they subject to punishment?

01:35.000 --> 01:42.000
That depends on the situation.
The Copyright Law provides for penalties.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
Aoi, have you ever seen the anti-voyeurism or illegal
downloading video shown before a movie theater screening?

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
I’ve seen it. The one with a fine of up to 10 million yen or
imprisonment of up to 10 years, right?

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I thought it was a severe penalty. Is it the same this time?

02:02.000 --> 02:12.000
Yes. Under the Copyright Law, the same penalties apply: a fine of
up to 10 million yen, imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
However, whether or not such penalties are applied depends on
the copyright owners’ policy.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
The policy of the copyright owners?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
It’s about the offence subject to complaint.

02:23.000 --> 02:32.000
Yes, that’s right. A private prosecution can only be brought
if the victim, in this case, the copyright owner, files a complaint.

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
In other words, in a case like this, if the copyright owner does not
intend to seek punishment, prosecutors will not be charged
with a criminal offense.

02:41.000 --> 02:50.000
However, it still violates the Copyright Law,
and we must be cautious not to let that happen.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
Also, in some malicious cases, such as on pirate sites,
it may be a non-criminal offense instead of a custodial offense.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
If you are concerned about this,
check back later for more information.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yes, I understand.

03:04.000 --> 03:14.000
In this case, you violate the Copyright Law
with the character lunch box but are not fined or imprisoned.

03:14.000 --> 03:24.000
How should we think about that?
Doesn’t the fact that you don’t say anything mean that
the copyright owner is allowing you to do so?

03:25.000 --> 03:35.000
That would be naive, I would say. First, the basic premise is that
you should use the work to the extent that it does not infringe
on copyright.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.500
We do not know whether the copyright owner is tacitly approving
of the use, whether they are not thinking of going to court,

03:44.500 --> 03:49.000
or whether they are thinking of going to court,
depending on the future situation. 

03:49.000 --> 03:59.000
So, regarding copyrighted character lunch boxes, please do not upload them to social media. Enjoy them only with a few people around you.

03:59.000 --> 04:08.000
As long as you do so, there is no problem since it constitutes a reproduction for private use, which is stipulated in the limitations of copyright.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
By the way,

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
a teacher once told me that he was worried that a profile icon
he zweeted might be in violation of the Copyright Law.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
What? I used to use an icon of my favorite anime character.
Was that no good?

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
I was so happy when I found someone with the same icon
as my favorite character, and we followed each other.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
I know some people use them as profile icons on social media.

04:35.000 --> 04:44.000
However, if you have used a cut-out image of an animated
cartoon as an icon without obtaining permission,
you are infringing copyright.

04:44.000 --> 04:53.500
You may want to check with the official website, as they may
provide icons that have been licensed for use on social media.

04:53.500 --> 05:05.000
Similarly, uploading a capture of a TV screen directly to social
media is an infringement of copyright.
Still, a link such as the URL of an official website is acceptable.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Learn what is good and what is not
and how to use it copyright-consciously.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
However, copyright is still very complicated and challenging.

05:18.000 --> 05:27.000
With everyone now using social media, it has become necessary
for everyone to be aware of the right of public transmission
among copyrights.

05:28.000 --> 05:37.000
The Copyright Law aims to contribute to the development of
culture by striking a balance between the protection
of copyright owners’ rights and fair exploitation.

05:37.000 --> 05:46.000
In cases such as this one, it is essential to properly understand
exactly what to use and how to use the work

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
so that our desire to support it as fans does not lead
to copyright infringement of our precious works.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Yes, understood.
