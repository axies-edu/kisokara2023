00:09.000 --> 00:11.500
Everyone looks a little troubled.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.500
That’s right. I’m a little unsure about my decision.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Yes, it isn’t easy if you don’t have any judgment criteria
to judge by.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.500
Let me explain the similarity of copyrighted works.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.500
First, the following three points must be identified to judge the
similarity of copyrighted works.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.000
The original expression is a copyrighted work;

00:37.500 --> 00:39.500
There is access (Ikyo in Japanese).

00:39.500 --> 00:41.500
There is a similarity.

00:42.500 --> 00:46.000
In this case, Kasumi’s original work is a literary work

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
because it “creatively expresses thoughts or sentiments.”

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
The term “copyrighted work” means a creatively produced
expression of thoughts or sentiments

01:02.000 --> 01:08.500
that falls within the literary, academic, artistic, or musical domain
under Article 2(1)(i) of the Copyright Law.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
However, as Kasumi said earlier,

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
a setting like the world of a novel is considered
an idea and is not copyrighted.

01:19.500 --> 01:26.000
There are a lot of manga and anime where the main character
is transported to another world and has activities there.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.500
I see. That’s just the setting, so even making something similar
is not a copyright infringement.

01:35.500 --> 01:42.000
The next is “access,” which means being based on existing works.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.500
If there is a coincidence of similarity, it is not based on existing
work and will not infringe on copyright.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Tanuki07 is commenting on Kasumi’s work this time,

01:55.000 --> 02:02.500
so we can assume he has read the story.
Therefore, there is a high likelihood of access.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
Finally, “similarity.” This literally means how similar something is.

02:12.500 --> 02:18.500
Kasumi said there was something that bothered her.
What do you mean by that?

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
There are a few descriptions, but the one that bothers me

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
is the beginning of the scene where the main character meets
the girl on land for the first time.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.500
They look almost identical!

02:50.000 --> 02:53.500
I wonder if using the same expression as
“lightly floating” (puka puka) is possible.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
I see. The structure of the sentences is similar,

02:58.000 --> 03:03.500
and it is true that “white foam lightly floating” (puka puka)
is not a commonplace expression.

03:03.500 --> 03:08.500
Since it is used in similar situations, there seems to be a similarity.

03:09.500 --> 03:15.500
In this case, there seems to be a copyrighted work,
access, and similarity.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
So, it’s plagiarism after all!

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Please settle down.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.500
In reality, there are some aspects of copyright similarity
that cannot be determined until a court case is filed.

03:29.500 --> 03:35.000
Even an amateur like me can see that they look very similar,
so is there something I don’t understand?

03:35.500 --> 03:40.000
Yes. From here on, I will talk about the law.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
The voice has changed.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.500
The Copyright Law is a law that has room for interpretation.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.500
It is necessary to consider each case and how we can interpret it.
In this case, we need to consider

03:56.000 --> 04:01.500
how many similar works existed before Kasumi’s work

04:01.500 --> 04:09.500
and what parts of Kasumi’s work show her creativity
compared to them.

04:10.000 --> 04:21.000
Regarding access, it might be possible
that tanuki07 wrote it first and released it later than Kasumi.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
So, without listening to tanuki07’s side of the story as well,

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
you won’t know the background and intent of
how this work was created.

04:31.500 --> 04:37.500
Judgment will be based on a comprehensive consideration of
all such matters.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.500
The experts will consider it comprehensively.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
What seems obvious to an amateur may not be so when you
consider the background.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
I felt that it was even more difficult to judge
whether it was plagiarism or not.

04:55.500 --> 05:00.000
Judging similarity is very complicated even for experts.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.500
Therefore, amateurs should not make hasty judgments.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.000
That’s right.

05:07.500 --> 05:12.000
There are also guidelines in “Let’s Write a Novel,”

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
so if you still have problems, you can contact the website owner.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.500
Yes! I’ll think about it.
