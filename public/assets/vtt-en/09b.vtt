Aoi, Naoya, you seem to be unconvinced.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
I’m confused because illustrations are copyrighted work,
yet Kasumi says they are not.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Because it looks similar, isn’t that copyright infringement?

00:25.500 --> 00:31.000
Let me explain what a copyrighted work is in the first place.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
The definition of a work is explained in Article 2(1)(i) as follows:

00:40.000 --> 00:51.000
“a creatively produced expression of thoughts or sentiments that
falls within the literary, academic, artistic, or musical domain.” 

00:52.000 --> 00:58.500
In other words, it must be ‘expressed,’
and ideas are not works of authorship.

00:58.500 --> 01:06.000
Since the painting style is an idea, mere similarity in style
does not constitute copyright infringement.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I see.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
When I think of it, I hear that cooking recipes
are not copyrighted works.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
Of course, if there is a work that looks similar to an original
picture, like a traced copy, there is a possibility of
copyright infringement.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
In the case of recipes, the cooking procedure itself is an idea.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Still, copyrightability may be found if expressed in writing,
so we must be careful.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
It means they might be creatively expressing thoughts
or sentiments.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.500
Yes. The difficult part is to
‘creatively express thoughts or sentiments.’

01:47.500 --> 01:56.000
In many cases, articles that describe facts as they are,
mere data, and commonplace expressions are not considered
copyrighted works.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
For example, when a celebrity passes away,

02:03.000 --> 02:11.000
an article such as ‘On what date and year he died of cancer
at what age’ is not considered a copyrighted work.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
In this case, in addition to that, an article that summarizes
the celebrity’s life in detail would be regarded as
a copyrighted work

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
As for the data, for example, even if you had trouble collecting
the height data of all the students at your university, 

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
it would not be copyrighted work because the data would be
the same no matter who collected it.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
As for commonplace expressions, for example,
“It was raining, so I put up my umbrella,” 

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
is not copyrighted work if it is an expression that anyone can use.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.500
I would have trouble writing something like that and be confused
if I was accused of copyright infringement.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.000
Yes, we would be in trouble.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
In this case, there is no original painting,
so the only similarities are in touch and color.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.500
Such a painting style is not copyrightable,

03:05.500 --> 03:14.000
and merely having a common style does not constitute copyright
infringement since it is not within the scope of protection
under the Copyright Law.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
You should not get so easily involved in such social media
outrage caused by these misunderstandings.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Good thing it happened before it went viral.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
You were both so excited and saying it was a rip-off!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I’ll be careful.
