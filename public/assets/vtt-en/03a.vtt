It’s done! I struggled with the last part, but it turned out well!

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
That’s right. Since I have the chance,
I’ll have Aoi and Naoya see it before it’s released.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
Adding a punchline at the end of the video will be better.
I’ll give it a try.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh, come to think of it, I haven’t sent the video I made yesterday.
I’ll have Kasumi take a look at it.

02:28.000 --> 02:38.000
Ah, this content doesn’t reflect my intention.
I wonder why she changed it without my permission!

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Maybe I shouldn’t have shown it to her.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
That’s strange.
It’s not like Kasumi to just ignore a read message...

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
Maybe it was a bad idea to edit it?
