00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
So, how about something like this?

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Yeah, it looks good. I think it’s pretty interesting.
Cat jump challenge!

00:39.000 --> 00:41.500
Mii-chan’s expression at this time is the best.

00:41.500 --> 00:48.500
Yes, I can’t take my eyes off her expression and movement,
and she doesn’t want to jump any higher than 90cm. 

00:48.500 --> 00:50.000
Have you applied for it?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.500
Right? There’s no way I can’t take another video like this
in the future! 

00:56.500 --> 01:04.000
The winning prize is 100,000 yen. I wonder what I’ll buy if I win!

01:04.500 --> 01:08.000
If you are selected, please give me sweets!

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Please treat me to dinner.

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay, okay! I should buy Mii-chan’s favorite foods, too.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
But if Naoya took a video like this, wouldn’t he immediately
upload it to social media and make it go viral?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.500
Is it okay to enter the competition?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
That is because it’s 100,000 yen!

01:34.000 --> 01:39.500
You can enter the competition first, and after you know the
outcome, you can upload it to social media.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.500
Videos don’t go bad after all!

01:41.500 --> 01:45.500
Are you sure? What about the assignment of copyright?

01:46.000 --> 01:50.500
Copyright? Assignment? What does that mean?
