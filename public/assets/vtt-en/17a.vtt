00:09.500 --> 00:16.000
Well, the presentation on copyright tomorrow
will be something like this?

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Even if you say “copyright” in one word,
there is so much content that it becomes complicated.

00:24.500 --> 00:28.000
If you don’t understand it correctly, you might make a mistake.

00:28.500 --> 00:34.500
Oh yeah, that reminds me, are car designs covered by copyright?

00:35.500 --> 00:38.000
Car designs? Why suddenly?

00:39.000 --> 00:46.500
Well, actually, I love cars and there’s a car
that I’m hoping to buy someday!...

00:49.500 --> 00:54.000
ah, this one.

00:56.500 --> 01:01.000
When this was announced,
there seemed to be some design issues,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
and it took a long time for it to be released.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Design issues?

01:06.500 --> 01:10.500
Yeah, it’s pretty similar to an overseas car,
or something like that.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
I’m studying copyright and stuff in college right now,
so that reminded me.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.500
Wow, I’m surprised Naoya likes cars.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.500
Well, yeah.

01:25.500 --> 01:30.500
The shape of the car and the front view are
so similar that a lawsuit was filed.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.500
Car designs are primarily drawn by people...

01:37.000 --> 01:41.500
so is the similarity a copyright issue?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I thought so.

01:45.500 --> 01:51.000
I don’t know, copyrighted work is...

01:51.500 --> 02:03.500
a creatively produced expression of thoughts or sentiments that
fall within the literary, academic, artistic, or musical domain,
right?

02:04.500 --> 02:08.500
That’s great! You remember the legal provisions so well.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
If that’s the case, the car’s design is a little different, isn’t it?

02:12.000 --> 02:19.500
It’s not the same as expressing thoughts or sentiments.
It’s a design for a practical item,
and it’s likely outside the scope of art.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.500
Okay. Then what is it? I’m curious.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
If there was a lawsuit, I guess there was an issue with something.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.000
It may be subject to another intellectual property right.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Another intellectual property right? What is that?
