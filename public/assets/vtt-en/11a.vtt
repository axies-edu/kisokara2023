00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
The centerpiece of the school festival is the stage event.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
How the program is put together depends on
the executive committee members’ capabilities.

00:18.500 --> 00:22.000
The stage events will determine the flow of people
at the school festival.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
What projects are coming up this year?
They’re due by the end of this week, right?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Yes, we have received them one after another.

00:31.500 --> 00:37.500
The band club hasn’t been able to sign up yet, but everyone is
practicing hard for this year’s performance!

00:37.500 --> 00:43.000
Band club is a must! I know we received applications
from the dance and drama clubs.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
The e-sports club wants a tournament,
so they wish to apply for stage events this year.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Looks like there will be a lot of stage events this year.
I hope it’s going to be a lot of fun!

00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
By the way, is this your first time dealing with copyright
procedures for a stage event?
Have you heard anything about what you need to check?

01:04.000 --> 01:08.500
What?
Are copyright procedures required for college festivals?

01:08.500 --> 01:15.500
I thought all stage events were free for spectators, right?
Since the school festival is free

01:15.500 --> 01:22.500
and the university is an educational institution, there is
no need to deal with copyrights for educational use.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
I’m in the band club, so I know about our music.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.500
But I didn’t care about dance or drama or anything like that...

01:33.500 --> 01:39.000
I wonder if e-sports also require some kind of procedures or
something because they project the game on screen...

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
I guess the executive committee member manual hasn`t been
passed on to everyone yet.

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
We must handle the band club’s performances, dances, plays,
and games separately.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
It is also the executive committee’s job to ensure we correctly
handle copyrights related to the stage.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Yes!
