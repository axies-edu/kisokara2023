00:08.000 --> 00:10.500
I’m sure you are all wondering. 

00:10.500 --> 00:19.000
You need the copyright owner’s permission
when you use someone else’s work,
such as a cartoon, animation, or photograph.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.500
Of course, we know about that too.

00:22.500 --> 00:27.000
We don’t do anything careless, like using copyrighted work,
we find online!

00:27.500 --> 00:35.500
Yes. If you use manga or anime scenes, etc., directly on your
poster, you violate the reproduction right. 

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
Therefore, if you want to use them on a poster,
you must obtain the copyright owner’s permission.

00:43.500 --> 00:48.000
Even in the case of famous works, such as famous cartoons,

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
you may get permission depending on the intentions of the
copyright owner and the intended use of the work.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
The creators of the work may be happy that you are using it.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.500
You should contact the copyright owner
if you want to use the work.

01:09.500 --> 01:14.000
For a comic book, do we have to contact the author directly?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
As a comic book enthusiast, let me explain.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
For creators who publish their work online, that is the way to go.

01:26.000 --> 01:34.000
In the case of publications such as manga published in magazines,
the publisher is often the point of contact.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.500
The publisher’s website will list the contact information for
copyright inquiries.

01:41.500 --> 01:46.000
The Agency for Cultural Affairs’
“How to Use Copyrighted Works Properly” page

01:46.000 --> 01:52.500
also provides contact information for various copyright-related
organizations, so checking there is a good idea.

01:53.500 --> 01:57.500
What should we do when we do not copy scenes from a manga or
anime as is,

01:57.500 --> 02:03.000
but rather someone good at illustrating draws new illustrations
based on the scenes?

02:03.500 --> 02:09.500
Even if someone is good at hand-drawn illustrations,
if the work is based on the work of another and
is similar enough to the original work

02:09.500 --> 02:18.000
that the essential characteristics of the expression of
the original work can be directly perceived from the work,

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
the copyright owner’s permission is necessary.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
Is it “similar to the extent that the essential characteristics of
the expression are directly perceived”?

02:32.000 --> 02:38.500
An act that relies on an existing work and expresses it in a new
and creative way by making changes

02:38.500 --> 02:44.500
and the like while maintaining the identity of the essential
characteristics of the expression is considered an “adaptation.”

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Since the copyright owner has the exclusive right to adapt
the work, permission is required.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.500
What about using only swords or costumes?

02:57.500 --> 03:04.500
If the props and costumes are not so distinctive and are only
similar to the extent that there are many similar expressions, 


03:04.500 --> 03:13.000
they are unlikely to be
“essential characteristics of the expression”
and may not be a problem from a copyright perspective.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
However, some publishers think permission is required for use

03:19.000 --> 03:28.500
because “if the dialogue or props remind the viewer of the
cartoon, there is a possibility that the viewer may misinterpret
the relationship with the cartoon.”

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
What are your thoughts on using the university’s mascot
character or emblem?

03:35.000 --> 03:39.500
Since the school festival is a university event,
it’s okay to use them, right?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.500
In most cases, universities have policies, regulations, and visual
identities

03:43.500 --> 03:50.500
for university mascot characters and emblems, and they are in
operation.

03:51.500 --> 03:57.500
Checking the university’s rules or consulting with the relevant
department in charge, for advice would be a good idea.

03:58.000 --> 04:06.500
Since it is for a school festival, you can probably get permission
to use them. Still, you might get a warning if you use them in a
way that lowers the dignity of the university.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.500
Today, in particular, we see a wide variety of copyrighted works
of others on the Internet.

04:15.500 --> 04:22.000
Unfortunately, a number of these are infringing on copyrights.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.500
Digital technology has made it easy to obtain the copyrighted
works of others,

04:28.500 --> 04:32.500
but be sure to use them with caution.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.500
Yes, understood!
