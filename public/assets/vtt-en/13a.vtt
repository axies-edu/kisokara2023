00:10.000 --> 00:14.500
I have pretty much finished. I’m pretty good at it, too.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.000
Amazing Kasumi. You are like a professional editor!

00:18.000 --> 00:23.500
Yeah. Now, I just need to export the data for YouTube...

00:28.500 --> 00:30.500
So, let’s check it out.

00:32.000 --> 00:52.500
Sound from a video of the band club performance

00:52.500 --> 00:54.000
End of video playback for the band club

00:54.500 --> 01:02.000
You upload this here. And the dance club is next.

01:03.000 --> 01:14.500
Sound from a video of the dance club performance

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, this is the same song as before.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.500
It’s interesting to dance to this hip-hop song.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.500
The band club performance was good,
but it’s different when real vocals are included.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.000
End of video playback for the dance club

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Aoi, you didn’t see this stage?
Everyone was in top form and it was amazing.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
What’s this?

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Copyright infringement? The previous performance was fine.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.500
I heard that YouTube has comprehensive contracts,
so the users don’t have to worry too much about it.

01:58.500 --> 02:04.000
It’s a bit scary, so, I’ll take a screen picture
and show it to Ryota and the others.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
The sound of taking a picture of a computer screen with a smartphone

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh, Naoya, Ryota! There’s something I’d like you to see!

02:22.500 --> 02:24.000
Kasumi, show them.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.500
Yeah, yeah. This is it.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Wow. I’ve never seen anything like this.
Will Kasumi’s account be suspended?

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
Hey, don’t say such scary things. Ryota, what does this mean?

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
It’s the same song, but the band club could upload it as it was,
but the dance club got angry.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.500
The video from the dance club is sung by a club member,
and the sound recording is the one you downloaded.

02:54.500 --> 03:01.500
Yes, the girls in the dance club were playing it on their phones,
so I think it was either downloaded or subscribed to.

03:01.500 --> 03:09.000
Do you mean they got mad because they used a copy?
Maybe they should have hooked up a real CD and played it.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.500
The JASRAC website says,

03:17.500 --> 03:26.500
“When you use CDs on the market or downloaded sound
recordings, you need permission from the neighboring
right owner.”

03:27.500 --> 03:30.500
Who is the neighboring right owner?
