00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Aoi, you’re thinking of releasing your original illustrations.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.500
How do you want users to use the illustrations?

00:17.500 --> 00:22.000
If users like my illustrations, they can use them.

00:22.500 --> 00:28.500
But I don’t want users to sell my illustrations
without my permission.

00:29.500 --> 00:35.000
At first, Aoi considered releasing the illustrations under
a Creative Commons license.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.000
Yes, that’s right.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.500
I thought it would be better to use a well-known license.

00:42.500 --> 00:48.000
Let’s take a closer look at the Creative Commons license first.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
A Creative Commons license is sometimes called a CC license
because of its long name.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
First, the license that Aoi had proposed for free use would be
a license called CC-BY.

01:05.500 --> 01:11.500
This is a license that allows the users to use the works freely
provided they give proper credit. 

01:12.500 --> 01:21.000
Credit is something you taught me before, such as the display of
the name under the attribution right and the work’s title.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.000
That’s right. You remembered well.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
In this case, Aoi, the copyright owner, will decide

01:32.000 --> 01:36.500
how to display the credit and indicate,
“Please write the credit in this way.”

01:38.000 --> 01:40.500
Yes, I see.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.500
Again, this CC-BY license, which can be used freely,

01:47.500 --> 01:53.000
means that you allow users modifications and commercial use.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.500
I see.

01:54.500 --> 01:59.500
What other licenses are available
under the Creative Commons license?

02:00.500 --> 02:05.500
You can add NoDerivatives if you want to add to the condition
that users cannot modify the work.

02:05.500 --> 02:12.000
Also, you can add a NonCommercial condition to the mark
if you wish to grant only non-commercial use.

02:12.500 --> 02:17.000
For example,
adding NoDerivatives and NonCommercial conditions

02:17.000 --> 02:23.500
would be a Creative Commons license called CC BY-NC-ND.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.500
I see.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
The Creative Commons license also has another condition
called ShareAlike, right?

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
I studied it before and found the idea of ShareAlike difficult
to understand.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Yes.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
Share-Alike requires that you use the same CC license
as the original work.

02:48.500 --> 02:55.500
For example, if the original work was licensed under a CC license
with NonCommercial and Share-Alike provisions,

02:55.500 --> 03:02.000
the modified work would also be subject to CC BY-NC-SA.

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
In the case of ShareAlike, with the same combination of CC
licenses, users can alter or redistribute the work,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.500
so there is no situation where ShareAlike and NoDerivatives
can be used simultaneously.

03:16.500 --> 03:23.500
I see. It’s named “ShareAlike” because it always shares the
intent of the license of the original work.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
Somehow, I’m thinking that it would be good to add
NonCommercial and ShareAlike conditions.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Aoi! Don’t be too hasty just yet.

03:33.500 --> 03:37.500
I think the Creative Commons license is a good idea,

03:37.500 --> 03:41.000
but by all means, it can only be used under certain conditions.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.500
If you want to add conditions other than those shown here,
how can you do that?

03:47.500 --> 03:51.000
I’ll answer that for you.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Under the Copyright Law,
there are provisions for the following license.

03:56.500 --> 04:05.000
“Article 63(1): The copyright owner may grant another person
authorization to exploit the work.

04:05.000 --> 04:13.000
Article 63(2): A person that obtains the authorization referred to
in the preceding paragraph is entitled to exploit the work to

04:13.000 --> 04:16.500
which that authorization pertains within the scope of the manner
and conditions of exploitation under that authorization.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.500
Article 63(3): A right of exploitation ... may not be transferred
without the consent of the copyright owner.”

04:24.500 --> 04:32.000
In this way, we can grant a license to other users by specifying
the conditions and method of use.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
That’s why sites that publish illustrations like Sashieyasan

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
have created a page called the “User Guide” to make it easier
for others.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
Are you making it easier to use by making the terms of use
public? I’m not a fan of reading them.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
No, no. I told you before to read the terms of use carefully.

04:56.500 --> 05:06.000
You cannot use the illustrations if there is no “User Guide”
and you do not have a CC license mark.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.500
You must always obtain a license to use it,

05:12.500 --> 05:18.000
so you should contact the copyright owner at the site
if you want to use it.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.500
This would make the barrier to use much higher.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
Creating a page such as a “User Guide”
also promotes using illustrations.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I see.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.500
If the CC mark does not meet the conditions, you will need to
create a page like a “User Guide”s.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.500
However, CC BY-NC-SA is okay for this project,
so I want to go with it.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.500
Yes! Just one question.

05:51.500 --> 05:56.500
I have heard that it will be for commercial use
if you charge an admission fee.

05:56.500 --> 06:02.000
If Aoi provided the illustrations under CC BY-NC-SA,

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
it would mean that users could not use them at events
that charge an admission fee, right?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
That’s true.

06:08.500 --> 06:12.500
However, the copyright owner can grant licenses individually,

06:12.500 --> 06:18.500
so in such cases, please contact Aoi and apply for permission.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.500
I see.

06:20.500 --> 06:27.000
I figured it out for the most part. I want to think it over again
and decide on the terms of use.
