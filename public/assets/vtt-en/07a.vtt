The band club is having a concert next month,
and I made a poster for that. What do you think?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
That’s pretty good.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
This illustration is material from “Sashieyasan,” right?
It’s convenient. I use it a lot, too, for presentations, etc.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah, it’s a hassle to make my own illustrations, and
there are so many different patterns, so I always rely on them!

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
So, once you have that poster, how do you advertise it?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
I want to print it in large print and put it up at universities
and neighborhood stores.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Also, I’m thinking of posting it on social media.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Can we use Sashieyasan material for posters and social media?

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
What do you mean by “Can we use”?
Sashieyasan is free material, right?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
It means free material, so it’s no problem.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
I’m pretty sure a “Terms of Use” on the site says
all sorts of things.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Maybe it’ll be fine, but you should check it out just in case.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
I’m not very good at reading terms of use.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
Kasumi, could you read it and explain it to me?
I’ll give you tickets to the concert...please!

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Oh well, if you insist.
