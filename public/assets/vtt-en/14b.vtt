00:08.000 --> 00:12.500
Naoya. You’ve read the application guidelines for the
competition, haven’t you?

00:13.000 --> 00:18.500
Yes, of course. The selected winner will receive 100,000 yen,
and the honorable mention will receive 10,000 yen.

00:18.500 --> 00:25.000
Naoya, this is not about the money but the description
in the application guidelines for copyright.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.500
Hmm?

00:32.000 --> 00:37.500
Ah, maybe this. What is it?

00:38.000 --> 00:45.500
The selected work will be published on this website.

00:45.500 --> 00:52.000
Applicants agree to assign the copyright
to the AXIS Short Video Production Association

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
for selected works after the application date.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Also, the copyright of other award-winning works,

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
such as honorable mentions unavailable on this site,
are assigned only for one year after the application date.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
How should I interpret this?

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Naoya, the copyright owner for this video is Naoya.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
When applying, check the copyright policy in advance.

01:23.500 --> 01:28.500
If you don’t, your work may become unintentionally unusable.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.500
Oh! What do you mean?

01:32.500 --> 01:34.500
I will answer.

01:35.500 --> 01:45.000
Firstly, you have learned before that copyright has economic
rights and moral rights.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.500
Here, the economic rights can be assigned to another party.

01:50.500 --> 01:55.000
In other words, some rights can be assigned to others.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
If it says simply copyright, it means economic rights.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
How does this relate to the “assignment of copyright”
described in the application guidelines?

02:09.500 --> 02:15.500
Ryota once asked Aoi to provide illustrations, right?

02:15.500 --> 02:18.500
Ah, the open campus one!

02:18.500 --> 02:25.000
Yes. I gave it to Ryota as it’s in the public domain,
so anyone can use it!

02:25.000 --> 02:34.000
That’s right. But what if the other party is
not Ryota but a design company?

02:34.000 --> 02:41.500
Let’s consider the case where there is financial
consideration for Aoi’s illustrations. 

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
This is an example of a service agreement.

02:45.500 --> 02:52.000
The design company that asks Aoi is asking for an illustration
for a specific purpose,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
so it is necessary to make a contract to meet that purpose.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
For example, a contract asks you to assign the copyright
because you will be paid for the illustration,

03:03.000 --> 03:08.500
or a contract asks you to let me use a part of the copyright.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.500
I see. There is a difference between assigning all the copyrights
and granting some rights.

03:18.500 --> 03:28.000
If I assign all copyrights, does that mean I won’t be able to use
the illustrations freely because I won’t be the copyright owner?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Yes, that’s what happens.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
What will happen in the case of this video competition?

03:36.500 --> 03:42.000
It says that the selected works for this competition will be
published on the website.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
In other words, it is confirmed that the selected works will be
publicly transmitted.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Since public transmission is essentially
the copyright owner’s right,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.500
it is necessary for the organizer of this competition,
a third party,

03:57.500 --> 04:05.500
to obtain permission for public transmission from the copyright
owner or to get the assignment of the public transmission right.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.500
I see. So, in the processing of this application,

04:15.500 --> 04:21.000
the copyright of all the selected works is assigned,
honorable mentions are assigned for one year,

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
and if they don’t win, the rights go back to the copyright owner.

04:26.500 --> 04:32.000
Kasumi you really focused on the issue of copyright assignment,
which was a good point.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.500
Yes, I had asked one of my seniors about handling copyrights
when submitting a paper.

04:38.500 --> 04:43.000
At that time, I studied about copyright assignments.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
We need to know about copyright assignments, too.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
It’s true that when you are at a university, you will be writing
papers, and papers will be published,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.500
so it is a good idea to learn about copyright assignments.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
Now, the handling of copyright in a competition like this is the content of a proper contract.

05:08.500 --> 05:15.500
Please ensure that you are carefully aware of how to handle your
important works before submitting your application to the
competition.

05:16.500 --> 05:21.000
Yes. I will read the application guidelines again, and then decide.
