00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Citations are essential for writing reports, papers,
and other documents. 

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Let’s take a closer look at the concept of this “citation”
and the rules under the Copyright Law.

00:22.000 --> 00:34.800
Citation uses text, figures, tables, etc., that are the work of
others in one’s reports or papers based on previously known
findings, facts, etc.

00:35.000 --> 00:48.800
It is used to develop one’s logic or to show one’s point
more clearly by contrasting one’s ideas
with those of others to show features and differences.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
For this reason, citations are almost always used
in reports and papers.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
The basic rule is to obtain the copyright owner’s permission
when using another person’s work.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Still, the Copyright Law allows “citation” as an exceptional
situation where a user can use the work
without the copyright owner’s permission.

01:11.000 --> 01:21.000
However, a user should note the following points when using
another person’s work as a “citation” as permitted
by the Copyright Law.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
The work must be a work that has already been published,

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
there must be a “master-subject relationship” between
the cited portion and the rest of the work,

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
and the “cited portion” must be made clear by brackets
or other means.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
These two requirements are generally necessary
to be considered a citation.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
The citation must conform to “fair practice,”

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
must be “within the legitimate scope” for the citation,
such as news reporting, criticism, or research,

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
and must “clearly” indicate the source of the citation.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Let’s think about it while looking at your reports.
Let’s start with Naoya’s report.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
What do you all think?

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
To use a work as a citation, you have to show
whose work it is and where it was from.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Yes. It’s called “indication of the source.”

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
I was going to write the URL of the site I referred to
or something at the end of the report.

02:35.000 --> 02:45.000
There seem to be problems besides the indication of the source.
For clarity, let’s color in the part Naoya cited in the report.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
This report doesn’t even clarify which part is the cited part.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
Yes. To be called a “citation,” the cited portion must be
clearly distinguished.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
In text, for example, citations must be separated
by brackets, etc.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Are there any other points?

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
In general, to be considered a “citation,” it is also necessary
that the cited portion and the rest of the report have
a “master-subject” relationship, i.e.,

03:20.000 --> 03:31.000
in the case of a report, your argument is qualitatively and
quantitatively, the master and the cited portion is the subject.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
Master-subject relationship.
I’m not sure if I’m quoting too much in my report.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
In addition, for a citation under the Copyright Law,

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
it must conform to “fair practice” and be “within the
legitimate scope” for the citation,

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
such as “news reporting, criticism, or research.

03:54.000 --> 04:07.000
Citations that cause significant economic disadvantage
to the copyright owner of the cited material are not allowed,

03:54.000 --> 04:07.000
so the quotation amount must be within the necessary range.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
I’d make sure to cite only what is necessary to develop
the argument, or readers might not consider the argument
by the author, Aoi.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
What is wrong with my report?

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
Kasumi cites the paper I plan to publish in her report. 

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
She cites it as a work that has not yet been published.
Is that okay?

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
For a work to be a citation under the Copyright Law,
the work must have been published.

04:39.000 --> 04:47.000
Unpublished works, such as pre-publication and
student-written reports, fall under this category.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Suppose Ryota’s paper has not yet been published. 

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
In that case, it does not meet the requirements for citation
under the Copyright Law.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
You cannot cite it without the copyright owner’s permission.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Yes.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
I guess my understanding wasn’t wrong after all.
However, 

05:08.000 --> 05:17.000
I heard the paper had just been published, so I think there
should be no problem if you rewrite the source correctly.

05:17.000 --> 05:26.000
Thank you. I will remember that citation applies
to a “published work.”

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
I hope you all master the correct citation method
to get your point across.
