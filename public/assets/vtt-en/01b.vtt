00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
The three of us were talking earlier. What is the difference
between an illegal download and a legitimate download?

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
I see. You were curious about downloading.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.500
Have you ever read the Copyright Law?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
I have read some of it. I’m not confident, though.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.500
No. I’ve never read it.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.500
I haven’t seen much.

00:31.500 --> 00:41.000
Laws usually have a written purpose at the beginning.
Let’s take a look at Article 1 of the Copyright Law.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
This Act shall apply mutatis mutandis to works and performances,
phonograms, broadcasts, and wire broadcasts.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
The purpose of this Act is to provide for authors’ rights
and neighboring rights with respect to works,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
as well as with respect to performances, phonograms, broadcasts,
and cablecasts, and to ensure protection for the rights of authors

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
and other such persons while according attention to the fair exploitation
of these cultural products, and thereby to contribute to cultural development.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
Here, there are the phrases
“attention to the fair exploitation of these cultural products”
and “protection for the rights of authors and other.” 

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
That is, the Copyright Law considers cultural development in terms of
exploiting and protecting the rights of those who created it.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.500
Is it fair exploitation...?

01:28.500 --> 01:33.000
An illegal recording in a movie theater, for example,
is certainly not fair exploitation,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
so, it makes sense that it should be banned.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
Right?　For example, if it were a movie, the writer, director, actors, etc.,
are working together to create a work of art, right?

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
They’re all professionals who make a living off the sales of their films.
That’s why they can create great works.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
But if pirated copies are widely available and used without permission,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
It would be impossible for those people to make a living.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
We won’t be able to enjoy the next film either!

02:05.000 --> 02:12.500
It’s a shame if we cannot watch our favorite movies
because of unscrupulous people who pirate them.

02:12.500 --> 02:23.000
That’s right. Nowadays, anyone can use text, music,
photos and videos, on their smartphone or computer,

02:23.000 --> 02:32.000
and you can make good quality copies using digital technology.
And it doesn’t cost much to make copies.

02:32.500 --> 02:39.000
If you take something physical that belongs to someone else,
the goods will not belong to the owner.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
However, the difference is that copyrighted works are
information that anyone can copy and use.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.500
Yes. So, reproduction rights, etc., should be appropriately defined
by law and we need to protect authors’ rights.

02:51.500 --> 02:58.500
Copyright means the right to reproduce.

02:58.500 --> 03:06.500
The programming software that you instructed us to use in class
is free of charge. Isn’t that a copyrighted work?

03:06.500 --> 03:09.500
Of course, it’s a copyrighted work.

03:09.500 --> 03:15.500
Article 2 of the Copyright Law defines copyrighted work.

03:16.000 --> 03:27.500
It is “a creatively produced expression of thoughts or sentiments
that falls within the literary, academic, artistic, or musical domain.”

03:27.500 --> 03:34.500
For example, Article 10 says
“works of computer programming” are also copyrighted.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.500
So, software is treated the same way as copyrighted work.

03:39.500 --> 03:45.500
Even though the software we are assigned to use in class
is sophisticated, why is it free?

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
It concerns who the author is
and how they want the work to be used.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
Companies and engineers develop software
because they need it,

03:59.000 --> 04:05.500
and some software is of higher quality
if the source code is available to the public.

04:05.500 --> 04:10.000
Many people are involved in the development
and use of the software.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.500
Such software is called open-source software.

04:14.500 --> 04:22.000
I see. But the engineers have to make a living, too.
What is the difference between this and a movie?

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
The company is paid by other companies to develop software
and pay the engineers.

04:30.000 --> 04:39.000
Still, I believe they also release software developed for their use,
and the engineers are involved in improving the software
released to the public.

04:39.500 --> 04:48.000
However, even the ones that are publicly available have terms of use.
It would be best if you were required to agree to the terms of use.

04:48.500 --> 04:54.000
For example, you can use it, but we don’t guarantee
its performance or quality, or

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
If you make an improved version, you must make it available
for free under the same terms and conditions,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
and so on.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
You need to check the terms of use carefully.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
Is it the same thing for the teacher’s class materials,
which are also made available to the public?

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Yes. The university also pays me,
and I am making this material available to the public

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
because I am making it available
for students to use in their classes.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.000
However, I am careful about using
other people’s copyrighted materials
in my materials because there are conditions.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Copyright Law protects authors’ rights to copyrighted works.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.500
Still, a wide range of rights can be exercised depending on
who the author is and how they want their works to be used.

05:41.500 --> 05:47.000
This is fundamental to understanding the Copyright Law.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
It depends on the author’s policy!
Thank you.
