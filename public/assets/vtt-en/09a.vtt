The illustration on the city poster says it’s a rip-off.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.500
Which one?

00:15.500 --> 00:17.000
Here you go.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.500
It’s getting a lot of “likes.” It seems to be trending a lot.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.000
It’s a copy of an illustration by the illustrator Tentenyanko.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.000
What kind of picture is Tentenyanko?

00:31.500 --> 00:33.000
Here it is.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Yes, they are similar, like the touch of this cat.
Or the use of pastel colors.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
You’re right. This is a rip-off. Maybe I’ll spread the word too.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
So, this means there is no original illustration based on this.
Is it ‘copyright infringement’ or not?

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
The style of the paintings is very similar,
but I have heard that art styles are not copyrighted.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
What? What do you mean?
