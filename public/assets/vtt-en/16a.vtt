Oh yeah, Kasumi said she was posting on the
“Let’s Write a Novel” site.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.500
Let’s read a little.

00:33.500 --> 00:38.000
Hmm, so the main character lives in an underwater world...

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
I like this scene where the character meets the girl on land!

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
I’m so excited! Someone named tanuki07 said,
“This setting is nice!”

00:57.000 --> 00:59.500
It has a great reputation.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.500
Kasumi, you're amazing.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.500
Today, I think I’ll read some of the others.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.500
Oh, this is tanuki07, who commented
on Kasumi’s novel the other day.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.500
I see you wrote it yourself – I’ll have a read!

01:33.000 --> 01:38.500
Hmm, I feel like I’ve read this somewhere before.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
This looks just like Kasumi’s!

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
It’s set in a world underwater, and the main character
falls in love with a girl on land...

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh, this isn’t good...

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
I found this last night.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.500
Is this a rip-off of Kasumi’s novel?

02:16.500 --> 02:20.500
It certainly looks exactly like Kasumi’s novel. That’s terrible.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.500
Exactly.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
What are you angry about? What’s wrong?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.500
Kasumi, this involves you.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.500
What? What do you mean?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.500
This is it. Kasumi’s novel has been ripped off!

02:39.500 --> 02:45.500
Ah, that... I was aware of it, too, but I didn’t think
there was anything I could do about it.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
What do you mean?

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
The world under the water, where a guy who “meets” a girl
on land and falls in love with her,

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
is just a setting and an idea. There’s no copyright on them.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.500
Also, the girls’ personalities are different,
and what happens after they meet is entirely different,

03:03.500 --> 03:06.000
so I can’t judge how much is the same.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.500
However, there are some parts
where I’m a bit concerned about the wording.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Hmm...
